ibm research dublin ireland email fcalabreieibmcom abstractin this paper we present a personal journey advisor application for helping people to navigate the city using the available bikesharing system for a given origin and destination the application suggests the best pair of stations to be used to take and return a citybike in order to minimize the overall walking and biking travel time as well as maximizing the probability to nd available bikes at the rst station and returning slots at the second one to solve the journey advisor optimization problem we modeled real mobile bikers behavior in terms of travel time and used the predicted availability at every bike station to choose the pair of stations which maximizes a measure of optimality to develop the application we built a spatiotemporal prediction system able to estimate the number of available bikes for each station in short and long term outperforming already developed solutions the prediction system is based on an underlying spatial interaction network among the bike stations and takes into account the temporal patterns included in the data the cityride application was tested with real data from the dublin bikesharing system keywordsjourney planner bikesharing mobility analysis mobile phone application i introduction in the context of urban mobility bike sharing programs have seen a great development during recent years starting from europe and quickly expanding to the rest of the world 1 bike sharing schemes have been reported to increase the cycling population and push cities to improve cycle facilities 2 moreover locating bike sharing stations in strategic locations close to public transport services has allowed improved connectivity to other modes of transit and so increased overall public transport usage intelligent management of bike sharing systems have seen a great interest within the research community researchers have been focusing on the problem of effective planning of bike sharing schemes 3 4 moreover intelligent tech niques to redistribute bikes have been proposed 5 data on the real time availability of bikes at stations is usually publicly provided by the service operator there has been an increased interest in applying mobile data management techniques to extract new insights from the bike usage see for instance 6 7 in the case of lyon where the service operator provided researchers with ne grained data containing origin and destination of bike trips further insights could be gained on the ows between stations 8 9 in this paper we focus on bike sharing systems as one of the means of transport within a multimodal transportation network of the city and deal with the development of a personal journey advisor which can advise citizens on how to navigate the city using the available multimodal network considering the uncertainties related to the availability of the different services 10 the idea of a journey advisor is not only to provide the citizen with a sequence of means of transport that could be taken to go from,"[101, 2103, 15637, 1037, 16014, 3512, 7997, 6631, 4990, 8619, 10147, 2180, 24863, 9980, 2470, 5772, 3163, 10373, 10147,

a given origin a to a given destination b in the city but also to advise on the most effective option in terms of traveling time waiting time probability to miss connections etc within this framework and with reference to the bike sharing system a static journey planner is quite easy to develop as the location of bike stations is xed however problems with a static journey planner might arise if suggested stations have no bikes or returning spots this problem indeed has been found to provide frustration in users if no good redistribution schemes are provided 5 to give an example as it will be shown in the next section bike stations in dublin can experience long periods of time 34 hours per day in which no bikes or returning spots are available in particular we focus on developing the journey advisor application with a prediction system that helps reduce this inconvenience by providing estimates of the availability of bikes at each station and use them to suggest the fastest and most reliable trip plan we also leverage publicly available bikesharing ow data for london and washington 11 12 to evaluate travel time and trip length distribution useful to understand bikers behavior in terms likelihood to travel a given distance this lets us model real users behavior whilst trying to avoid to suggesting too short or too long bike trips existing applications related to bike sharing systems can provide two possible services on one hand they statically suggest origindestination station without taking into account real time information on the other hand there are applica tions or web sites that in realtime provide the number of available bikes at the stations however to the best of our knowledge they do not provide predicted availability nor do they allow planning of a journey our system completes the services offered by the existing 2012 13th international conference on mobile data management 978076954713812 2600 2012 ieee doi 101109mdm201216 306 2012

previous ones as i we adopt similarity between time series of different stations to improve prediction performance ii we leverage the periodicity in the time series to build a temporal model of evolution of the time series the paper is structured as follows section ii describes the dataset used in this paper section iii describes the proposed journey advisor problem with proposed spatiotemporal pre diction systems and how to build the neighbouring structure for the spatial prediction section iv presents a real case of study section v provides discussion and limitations section vi presents conclusive remarks and future work ii data description the dataset is obtained crawling the web site of the dublinbikes system1 the dataset under analysis covers 27 days from january 4th 2011 to january 31st 2011 for every minute the current number of available bikes is recorded for each of the 42 bike stations of the dublinbikes system a temporal pattern in the data despite the presence of some noise the data includes regularities and temporal patterns in fig 1a and fig1b we compare the total number of available bikes during a week day and a weekend day firstly we highlight that the trends depicted during working days are very similar among different weeks and this is conrmed also looking at the weekend days we notice that the trends described by the week days and the

section a prediction in the journal advisor system one of the most important parts is developing prediction algorithms to infer the precise number of available bikes in each station nminutes ahead rather than the binary status of the bike availability the awareness of the precise number of available bikes can be useful for both operators and nal users the former can use this information to better evaluate the system performance the latter can use it to have a more accurate knowledge of the current status of a station there are several approaches to achieve this goal re cently 6 showed an autoregressive moving average arma model to forecast the available number of bikes and 7 showed a simple bayesian network based prediction algorithm however both approaches present some limita tions first of all arma models are only useful for station ary signals so we need to improve the model as the mean and variance of the bike availability signals are varying over time bringing nonstationarity although the naive bayesian prediction classication based on bayesian network 7 seems very simple but useful in bike prediction the authors used small number of classes according to percentages eg 5 classes 0 20 80 100 rather than predicting the actual available number of bikes which instead would be needed for accurate journey planning if groups of more than one user are interesting in planning a trip the other issue in bayesian network forecasting in 7 is that the number of conditional factors is too small so that the prediction is not much better than simple last value lv prediction3 in general the performance of a bayesian network can be improved by adding more factors but this leads to an exponential size of the probability table and thus to time consuming simulations in addition both approaches arma and bayesian network have considered each station as independent we instead try to leverage the clear correlation between stations bike decrease in an origin station are correlated to increase in a destination station closeby stations usually have similar usage to improve prediction performances therefore we develop several algorithms to address the above limitations we propose a mathematical model for handling nonstationarity of the data by using autoregres sive integrated moving average arima model one of our contributions is to deal with spatiotemporal prediction by using signals from neighboring stations and seasonal trend in order to inlcude this information we need to modify the arima model by rya t p i1 irya ti 0 nnea p j1 njryn

moreover a peculiar trend emerges if we consider the different neighboring structures included in the model for instance the arima algorithms with complete neighbors structure have high rmse compared to others the training dataset used is not large enough to properly estimate myriads of unknown parameters where the number of unknown parameters increases according to the complexity of the neighbouring structure in addition the approaches using voronoi and regression methods show better performances compared to knnsim and the complete neighbors one of the most interesting results is that while arimane outperforms arimanese in all neighbor struc ture for the short term prediction arimanese becomes more accurate than arimane in the long term prediction this is because the neighbors and past observations are important factors to provide accurate short term prediction however we can obtain more informative and signicant information from the temporal trends than the neighbours and

the application could be extended to allow for that real time adaptation of the predictions that can trigger the application to recommend the user even during hisher bike trip to change destination station as predicted availability changes it could happen that the suggested station might switch over time between two closeby stations as their estimated travel time might be very close to avoid this closeby stations could be clustered together so that predictions could be done for a group of stations instead of individual ones once the user arrives in the vicinity of the group of stations the application could decide which station among the ones in the group minimizes the optimization cost function and so suggests the best one vi conclusion in this paper we have proposed a personal journey advisor application for navigating the city using the bikesharing sys tem to develop the application we built a spatiotemporal prediction system based on arima extended to include seasonal trends and regressionbased spatial correlations outperforming already developed solutions we modeled the uncertainties related to the prediction system and real bikers behavior in terms of travel time and used them to solve the journey advisor optimization problem the application was developed and tested on data from the dublin bike sharing system as future work we are planning on testing prediction performance on larger datasets and on different cities and on evaluating prediction systems as function of the features of each station we are also working on integrating other transportation modes to develop a multi modal journey advisor references 1 s a shaheen s guzman and h zhang bikesharing in europe the americas and asia past present and future journal of the

predict how many bikes are to be rented and returned throughout the city in this paper we propose a hierarchical consistency prediction hcp model to predict the citywide bike usage in the next period first an adaptive transition constraint adatc clustering algorithm is proposed to cluster stations into groups making the rent and transition at each cluster more regular than those at each single station second a similaritybased efcient gaussian process regressor sgpr is proposed to respectively predict how many bikes are to be rented at differentscale locations ie at each station each cluster and in the entire city besides largely improving the training and online prediction efciency our regressor considers external impacted factors addresses the data unbalance issue and better captures the nonlinearity in spatiotemporal data third we design a general least square gls formulation to collectively improve those obtained predictions via a mutual reinforcement way gls makes the nal predictions for rent more reasonable considering the causality between rent and return a transition based inference tinf method is designed to infer the citywide bike return demand based on the

introduction b ikesharing systems are widely deployed in many major cities eg new york city paris and beijing proving a healthy and convenient transportation mode to citizens a user can rent or return a bike at a random station by swiping her membership card generating a bike rent or return record which includes her user id the bike id the station name and a timestamp as bike usage throughout the city is skewed a system always has some jammed stations which do not have enough free docks and some starved ones which lack bikes leading to customer loss system operators try to solve this problem via constantly repositioning bikes among stations by trailer 15 however a realtime monitoring based bike reposition strategy cannot tackle this problem satisfactorily as it is too late to take

jammed and starved stations have already been observed especially when largescale reposition is required ie there is a long distance between the stations to load and unload bikes therefore accurate prediction for how many bikes are to be rented and returned throughout the city is necessary based on which bike reposition can be conducted in advance ie delivering bikes from stations which are predicted to be jammed to those that are predicted to be starved however predicting the citywide bike usage accurately is very challenging for three reasons first being impacted by multiple factors the rent demand at each station uctuates largely fig 1a shows the hourly rent demand at a random station in one week which conrms the above claim time bike usage is largely impacted by hour of day and day of the week eg bike trafc in a city spikes in morning and evening rush hours while collapsing in other periods on weekday however we cannot observe rush hours at weekend or on a holiday as commutes are not necessary on these days meteorology outdoor riding is signicantly impacted by meteorology severe weather conditions prevent customers from riding but to choose other transpor tation modes such as taxi and bus besides increas ing outdoor temperature encourages more people to ride while having a negative effect when it becomes too high heavy wind is another negative factor for riding event unexpected events also largely affect bike usage an accident leading to a jam may encourage more people to ride instead of taking taxi nor bus a festival celebration may lead to a sharp return increase at stations surrounding the celebration area before the event while a large rentincrease there after that second most transitions in a bikesharing system seem to be random trips

to estimate which station a rented bike is to be returned thus hard to predict the return demand at each station third external factors impacting bike usage are unbal anced observed as we can imagine there are much more sunny hours than the rainy ones similar issue also exists between common hours and those with unexpected events besides the temperature and wind speed almost concentrate in some ranges while rarely scatter at other values however traditional machine learning methods are trained to t the major conditions while scarifying accuracy under the minor ones separately training a model under each condition makes the training data under the minor ones very sparse which also compromises the model accuracy considering these challenges we propose a hierarchical consistency prediction hcp model to predict the citywide rent and return demand our contributions can be summa rized into fourfold an adaptive transition constraint adatc cluster ing algorithm is proposed to cluster stations into groups adatc iteratively clusters stations based on their geographical locations and bike usage patterns obtaining clusters with more regular rent and transi tion not only than

cluster into n1 k1 n n2 k1 n nk2 k1 n groups where n is the total number of stations in a system and is a rounding operator the dissimilarity based on which geoclustering is con ducted is a tradeoff between geographical distance and checkout difference dening the checkout pattern at a sta tion s by eq 1 where ui is the average checkout at s in the ith time slot in table 2 we can measure the

system improving the prediction accuracy and guarantee the hc property 33 intercluster transition learning considering the causality between rent and return predict ing where and when a rented bike is to be returned is very important for checkin inference we only discuss how to learn intercluster transition probability and ride duration here while the interstation ones can be obtained in a same way 331 intercluster transition matrices from one cluster to another one the transition probability in t describes how probable that a bike rented from the rst cluster in t is to be returned to the second one only rent time is constrained to t while the return time can be a ran dom possible value based on the transition probability introduced above we dene the intercluster transition matrix in t as trt whose entry trtik describes the transi tion probability from cluster i to k in period t as we can imagine the intercluster transition prob ability varies from time to time besides transitions are impacted by events however meteorology does not obvi ously affect the transitions any more eg when the weather is severe most customers change to another transportation mode instead of changing their destinations therefore to estimate the transitions we only consider two factors ie time and event time factor for simplicity we assume that the transition probability is constant in each time slot in table 2 there fore for each time slot we estimate the transition matrices under normal conditions without unexpected events by maximum likelihood estimation 12 on the historical bike usage data generated in this time slot data generated under or not under events are not distinguished in this step as unexpected events rarely happen thus almost not impact the estimation results intercluster transition matrix for a normal period is trt event factor as discussed previously event data are too hard to collect thus we adopt transitions in the most recent period to report whether any unexpected event happened at any location to a specic cluster s in t whether its tran sition pattern is impacted by events is judged by eq 22 where trts denotes the row in matrix trt corresponding to cluster s while trs t is the practically observed transition probability at s in t v is a threshold tr 1 t s trs t 2 v 22 if eq 22 is satised unexpected events happened at cluster s in t thus we update the normal intercluster transi tion matrix trt1 by replacing its row corresponding to cluster s with its most recent transition probability trs t 332 intercluster ride duration meteorology time and events are no longer important impacted factors to ride duration eg trafc jam usually leads to longer travel time for vehicles but not bikes severe weather conditions which may signicantly impact the ride duration make users choose another transporta tion mode instead of spending much more time to ride therefore we learn a constant ride duration distribution for each pair of clusters according to historical data majority of the trips can be completed in less than one,"[101, 2291, 9229, 1996, 17547, 10640, 1998, 11302, 1996, 16731, 3200, 3943, 6970, 20464, 19966, 2121, 6653, 4083, 6195,

clustering algorithm adatc algorithm has three parameters r1 k1 and k2 parameter r1 is to tradeoff the geographical distance and checkout dissimilarity while k1 and k2 respectively deter mine how many groups the stations are clustered into in geoclustering and tclustering step for simplicity we tune them one by one conduct geoclustering by setting r1 2 f0 01 15g and k1 2 f40 41 60g clustering results are then mea sured by the average innercluster geographical distance and checkout dissimilarity figs 10a and 10b show these two metrics respectively averaged over k1 2 f40 60g for each specic r1 value as we can see an increasing r1 makes the distance increase while the dissimilarity to decrease this is very reasonable considering its tradeoff role parameter value r1 04 is chosen not only because it is an elbow point in b but also that its corresponding dis tance in a is acceptable set r1 04 and conduct geoclustering estimate the above two metrics for each k1 2 f40 60g and respec tively show them in figs 10 c and 10d as we can see there is not an obvious elbow point however as a large value for k1 may compromise the regularity of bike usage at each cluster we select the parameter value k1 50 to ensure that each cluster is neither too large thus can constrain the innercluster distance nor too tiny to ensure that the bike usage in each cluster is regular to tune another parameter k2 a new metric is required to measure how concentrated the intercluster transitions are for simplicity we measure this by rst summing the largest one hundred entries in the intercluster transition matrix in each time slot and then average these sums over time slot to obtain the nal concentration metric the larger the better setting r1 04 and k1 50 adatc is con ducted for

cluster distance keeps decreasing however there is a tradeoff between innercluster dissimilarity and transition concentration ie an increasing k2 makes the dissimilarity increase although the

predict by weighted aver age however msp does not predict clusterlevel nor stationlevel bike usage directly but by allocating the total usage in the whole city to each cluster or station as we can see

satisfactorily which we think is also reasonable as bike usage at each station is too uctuating to predict accurately it is almost impossible to accurately predict those in higher levels by adding the cer tain of them our proposed model hcp which predicts bike usage at each location by an optimal combination strategy performs the best as hcp considers both global informa tion ie the total usage in

help to improve prediction accuracy we do adopt hcp to predict clusterlevel checkout respec tively based on clustering results obtained by gci adatc and ggii adopt tinf to predict clusterlevel checkin respec tively based on the above three clustering results fig 10h shows the prediction rmser for checkin where the red curve is for all testing periods while the black one is for anomalous periods as we can see adatc outper forms gci and gcii this is reasonable as none of gci nor gcii considers the transition concentration among clusters thus cannot predict the intercluster transition accurately which is important in tinf considering space limit we ignore the gure for check out prediction but summarize their results as gcii adatcgci where means better than this is because that gcii can guarantee the regularity of checkout at each cluster thus making prediction easier however adatc can also guarantee the regularity to some extent consider ing both checkout and checkin adatc is the

static bike reposition means the reposition process is conducted when the system is closed or in the night while the dynamic one means repositioning when system operates to solve these two problems optimiza tion models 17 16 19 20 23 24 based on check out and checkin prediction are usually adopted the objectives are to minimize the customer loss customer dissatisfaction or the total reposition distance etc li et al 13 proposed a reinforcement learning based model to conduct dynamic bike reposition in citi bike to minimize the total customer loss in a long period userbased repo sition approaches 24 27 28 29 mean that system operators offer money to users and ask them to rent or return at specic stations userbased strategies are more exible in practical system operation although it is hard to estimate how much money to offer 7 conclusions our work solves the citywide bike usage prediction prob lem in a bikesharing system an adatc clustering algo rithm is rst proposed to cluster stations in a system into minclusters a hcp model considering external impacted factors is then proposed to predict the checkout throughout a city hcp can guarantee the hc property of a hierarchy thus largely improves the prediction accuracy to predict the checkin at each location we further design a tinf method to infer how many bikes are to be returned there in the future tinf considering the causality between rent and return thus can obtain better performance than baselines experiments on realworld data are conducted to conrm the effectiveness of our model for future work we mean to generalize our model to consider more spatiotemporal data sources and deeper hierarchies real event data can be col lected and considered too references 1 g e p box g m jenkins g c reinsel and g m

challenges such as carbon emission reduction urban transport multimodality and mitigation of pandemic hazards emphasising on the implementation of shared modes such as bikesharing systems this paper poses a research question and introduces a corresponding systematic literature review focusing on machine learning techniques contributions applied to bikesharing systems to improve cities mobility the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalyses prisma method was adopted to identify specic factors that inuence bikesharing systems resulting in an analysis of 35 papers published between 2015 and 2019 creating an outline for future research by means of systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis machine learning algorithms were identied in two groups classication and prediction keywords bikesharing systems machine learning classication prediction prisma method 1 introduction changes are taking place in the future development of the transport sector to this aim concrete plans are already in place such as the sustainable development goals sdgs 1 the new urban agenda 2 and the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd greening transport 3 and adopted by united nations member states since 2016 to cope with these challenges the new urban agenda and oecd greening trans port set up the guidelines for a sustainable future that connects to the sdg11 cities and communities 4 bikesharing systems bss improve urban accessibility multimodality in transporta tion and mobility sustainability and more cities in the world are implementing such sharing modes to tackle increased expansion of urban mobility air pollution and changes in urban mobility patterns and behaviour trends exacerbated by the recent pandemic crisis since 2016 more than 1000 bikesharing systems are running in 60 countries 5 and many improvements have been made in bikesharing systems the latest systems allow realtime data collection using sensors and wireless communications generating large quantities of data 6 the collected data improve intelligent processes of data analytics through machine learning techniques the aim of this paper is to contribute with literature evidence to the sustainable implementation of bikesharing systems particularly this systematic literature review targets the identication of the most relevant machine learning techniques applied in bikesharing analytics with an impact on and contributions to cities mobility therefore the broad analysis of this paper is useful to understand stateoftheart solutions as well as gaps in the current research challenges in mobility nowadays aim to nd the latest scientic contributions for the development of machinelearningbased techniques to provide solutions to

prediction applied to bike sharing systems clustering algorithms were analysed in section 37 application and method analysis and are mostly applied to imbalanced bike usage patterns regarding demand reviewed papers apply clustering algorithms to a bikesharing systems data by combining temporal and spatial attribute variables more specically three clustering algo rithms namely hierarchical clustering 262934 community detection clustering 2627 and kmeans clustering 273537 were the most commonly used according to caggiani 27 who analysed the performance of the three clustering algorithms kmeans clustering has been proven to be the best clustering algorithm to rebalance bikesharing usage patterns prediction methods are evolving and there is now a wide variety of machine learning techniques and applications a random forest rf has been commonly used to explore the impact of factors on the bikesharing usage frequency to understand the timevarying ow patterns and the spatial distribution of bikesharing systems studies 152130343840 have been conducted to improve the understanding of bikesharing usage patterns and obtain insights into dynamic deployment of the bikesharing system in urban areas a gradient boosting tree gbt and random forest rf were found 41 to provide the best results for the systemlevel demand using similar features a conventional articial neural network ann is one of the most used articial intelligence algorithms for modelling timeseries data in transportation however an ann is unable to fully capture the characteristics of timeseries data 121323 as an ann does not take into account the temporal dependencies in the model structure to overcome the limitation associated with anns feedforward deep neural networks have been proposed such as the recurrent neural network rnn recurrently connecting hidden layers at different timestamps an rnn 2441 accounts for the temporal dependencies and produces good predictive performance on timeseries data lately the rnn has evolved 21 with optimal model structures sequence length time interval for better prediction moreover traditional rnns have a difculty in nding the optimal window size in modelling timeseries data as they rely on predetermined time lags to learn temporal sequence processing 4243 recurrent neural networks namely long shortterm memory units lstms are a type of articial neural network designed to recognise patterns in sequences of data such as numerical timeseries data from sensors rnns and lstms differ from other neural networks as they have a temporal dimension an lstm nn is used to develop a dynamic demand forecast model in studies 32 for stationfree bikesharing systems to overcome the limitations associated with rnns in modelling timeseries data with longterm

machine learning techniques applied to bsss future research might benet by looking at specic machine learning techniques especially prediction models applied to bsss 5 conclusions the prisma methodology outlined the slr and created an organised view of machine learning techniques applied to bsss for future information retrieval recent technological developments in stationfree bsss fuelled new research in the last couple of years with contributions to service improvement in urban mobility our survey showed that in the latest bss studies classication and prediction prob lems are the two issues mostly addressed by machine learning techniques clustering analysis is mainly used to explore bss spatiotemporal patterns at different city scales hierarchical clustering is showed to be the most efcient algorithm to group sites with similar characteristics 33 unlike kmeans clustering which is best suited to rebalance bss usage patterns 26 the rf is a robust algorithm to discard outliers and noise and has an advantage of dealing with complex nonlinear and highdimensional data additionally it estimates the importance of the input variables of different factors the literature 37 showed that it has a more sophisticated accuracy rate compared to the multinomial logistic regression method in a latest study 33 an rf is mainly used to analyse general features of travel distance and time of bss trips our slr results suggest that lstm nns a deep learning technique are the recom mended model to be used to identify mobility patterns of the stationfree bss as well as for dynamic demand forecasting models able to predict the travel demand of stationfree bikesharing isprs int j geoinf 2021 10 62 23 of 25 given the identied knowledge gaps we can raise some recommendations for fu ture work within the overarching theme of machine learning techniques applied to bsss promising areas for further research lie in modelling the spatiotemporal dimension of bsss in urban mobility in analysing synergies with other transport modes in multimodal networks 45 and in addressing gaps on urban mobility bridging with machine learning techniques applied to public transport multimodality

demand to deviate from baseline levels identifying such outliers keeps historic data reliable and improves forecasts in this paper we show how outliers can be identied by clustering stations and applying a functional depth analysis we apply our analysis techniques to the washington dc capital bikeshare data set as the running example throughout the paper but our methodology is general by design furthermore we offer an array of meaningful visualisations to communicate ndings and highlight patterns in demand last but not least we formulate managerial recommendations on how to use both the demand forecast and the identied outliers in the bikesharing planning process keywords analytics forecasting outlier detection data visualisation arxiv220406112v2 statap 30 jan 2023 a preprint 1 introduction and background as a component of sustainable urban mobility bikesharing is on the rise in cities around the world empirical research as exemplied by teixeira et al 2021 and blazanin et al 2022 has been dedicated to highlighting requirements and benecial impacts of the related modal shifts in urban transport as pointed out in the related references careful planning is required to make socalled shared micromobility systems more attractive than less environmentally friendly alternatives such as cars while the concept of shared micromobility also includes escooters and dockless bikeshares here we focus on systems that rely on a set of dedicated stations as for example luo et al 2019 point out while dockless systems offer more convenience and equity to users their co2 footprint is signicantly higher due to the reduced lifespan of vehicles on the other hand stationbased sharing systems require carefully planned station locations and wellbalanced inventory levels to ensure adequate service provision when for example a station is mostly used to pickup bikes rebalancing ensures a steady supply and avoids service denials planning for bikesharing operations means determining for example the best distribution of stations across the service area ciancio et al 2017 the best distribution of bikes across stations zhu 2021 and the best path for truck drivers to take when redistributing bikes each day schuijbroek et al 2017 when taking a proactive approach to planning optimisation procedures that determine stock levels per station rely on predicted demand when taking a reactive approach quick online decisionmaking is crucial to maintain a good service level since inefcient rebalancing operations are a major cost driver for operators schuijbroek et al 2017 identifying demand outliers to improve efciency in bikesharing systems is highly important unaccountedfor outliers can affect bikesharing systems in two ways i outliers in historic data contaminate the forecasts used in future inventory management and ii on the day demand levels may indicate that the schedule is nonoptimal for the current day and drivers should be rerouted therefore identication of outlier demand has several potential benets for bikesharing forecasting and planning 1 detecting outliers early in the day through online analysis as proposed in rennie et al 2021b allows for rapid interventions to better reallocate bikes on a given day 2 removing any detected outliers from training data for demand forecasting would improve results on predicting reference demand curves 3,"[101,

if outliers can be attributed to specic events previously unknown extending future forecast models to include such events can improve forecasts 4 even when explanatory factors for outliers cannot be determined if such outliers are concentrated spatiotemporally in certain stations this knowledge can better support planning decisions and 5 identifying changes in the underlying reference model when patterns in the detected outliers are observed can trigger a review of the current forecasting method we dene outlier demand as a shortterm change in demand resulting in usage levels which deviate from regular usage note that to count as an outlier a demand shift has to exceed the general degree of random variation observed in demand over time in this paper we focus on demand observed at bikesharing stations as these are the target of inventory rebalancing efforts in contrast to other classical mobility problems such as those related to buses or trains bikesharing capacity is on the vertices of the transport network rather than on the edges as an example of existing work in this area neumannsaavedra et al 2021 discuss the problem of variability in bikesharing demand and propose a rulebased method to adjust the redistribution plan when demand differs from the forecast in a simulation study they show that service levels can be improved when adjustments are made to the optimal redistribution plan wider literature on outlier detection in transport planning is scarce eg rennie et al 2021a consider identifying and correcting for outliers in revenue management systems in railways talvitie and kirshner 1978 nd that outliers can have a substantial effect on the predictions of usage of different urban transport modes but only apply a simplistic trimming method to identify outliers in the road trafc domain guo et al 2015 suggest a procedure for identifying outliers in real time based on the conditional variance of predictions and determine that incorporating information on such outliers into future predictions increases the systems performance furthermore as indicated eg in basole et al 2021 to account for demand outliers and adjust planning experts require meaningful visualisations therefore we propose a set of visualisations to help identify and analyse spatial and temporal patterns in the detected outliers for example given shifts in the availability of urban infrastructure a subset of stations may be predisposed to outliers and as such this area would be a good target for a temporary popup station throughout this paper we assume that bikesharing companies employ analysts who are in charge of strategic decisions such as where to locate stations tactical decisions such as what number of bikes should be available on any given day at those stations and operational decisions such as onthey rebalancing of bikes in that we follow 2 a preprint previous research such as wang et al 2016 who expect analysts to evaluate bike share programs and station locations or ma et al 2021 who consider analysts or dispatchers to be in charge of rebalancing operations to combine automated outlier detection manual analysis demand forecasts and planning we suggest the following process for analysing bikesharing demand data,"[101, 2065, 2041, 14355, 2015, 2064, 2022, 7108, 2000, 28699, 2594, 2824, 3130, 4242, 8402, 2925, 19939, 4275,

of process for analysing bikesharing demand data figure adapted from rennie 2021 in this paper we analyse the capital bikeshare data set which is publicly available at capital bikeshare 2021 this data set is commonly used to test forecasting approaches for bikesharing ma et al 2015 hamilton and wichman 2018 yet these methods typically do not account for outliers in section 2 we introduce the data set and perform an exploratory analysis section 3 and section 4 then model the temporal and spatial patterns in demand for bikesharing in section 5 we provide a methodology for identifying outlying demand for bikesharing services the results of applying the outlier detection method to the capital bikeshare data are then discussed in section 6 in summary this paper contributes i an indepth analysis of temporal patterns in usage of capital bikeshare services ii a method for spatial clustering of bikesharing stations based on geographic proximity and similarity of usage patterns iii an investigation of temporal trends in detected outliers and the factors that may cause them and iv an analysis of spatial patterns of the outliers detected our methodology is datadriven and general by

any outlier detection procedure will likely simply detect baseline trend characteristics as outliers for example there is a much higher level of variability in demand on weekends in summer if we failed to account for this before performing the outlier detection procedure many of the detected outliers would occur on saturdays in the summer months by rst accounting for known temporal patterns the detected outliers are more likely to be genuine outliers rather than explainable patterns already known to analysts similarly if we do not account for spatial baseline variability and instead aggregate data across all stations then we will simply detect unused or extremely busy stations as outliers conversely if we assume all stations behave independently then the increased noise makes it more difcult to detect outlying usage patterns as such before implementing the outlier detection procedure outlined later in section 5 we carry out a twostep process to i remove known temporal patterns and ii spatially cluster stations which behave similarly these two steps are key in identifying meaningful outliers as we shall show 31 background bikesharing demand forecasting within the

data trafc patterns and knearest neighbours to make spatiotemporal demand predictions over short time horizons between 15 minutes and 4 hours for the capital bikeshare data the choice of forecasting approach will likely affect the outcome of outlier detection in the following we discuss and apply two methods of predicting the baseline temporal patterns in the data i functional regression to account for changes in mean and ii temporal partitioning to account for changes in variance beyond the model presented here alternative approaches could be used to account for trend and seasonality and establishing a baseline for bikesharing demand in general any forecasting or modelling approach from which residuals can be obtained could be used instead after the temporal patterns have been accounted for and the residuals obtained we are then able to analyse the spatial correlations to group together stations which deviate from the baseline demand forecast in a similar way as we shall discuss later in section 4 32 functional regression mean daily usage patterns differ systematically across days of the week months and years we apply a functional regression model ramsay et al 2009 to

our functional regression approach accounts for different mean usage patterns but it does not account for the differing interdaily variances the simplest option to obtain a data set with homogeneous interdaily variance is to temporally partition the full data set while we could partition based on each weekday month and year this would result in around 7 a preprint 4 observations per partition an insufcient number to inform outlier detection in deciding how to partition the data there is a tradeoff between having reasonably constant interdaily variance within each group and ensuring there is enough data within each group in order to establish patterns therefore we group together days months and years where the interdaily variances are sufciently similar from figure 4 it is clear that weekdays monfri are similar to each other and weekends satsun are also similar to each other the differences between the interdaily variance across different months is less clear dening summer as april through to october then months within summer exhibit similar interdaily variance patterns as do months within winter november to march further analysis of the variance in appendix a11 supports this partitioning all years are grouped together this results in four partitions i summer weekdays ii winter weekdays iii summer weekends and iv winter weekends as displayed in figure 5 cf note that we do not attempt to remove the intradaily variability of these residuals with further parametric modelling as instead we turn to functional data analysis to detect outlying curves from these residual daily usage patterns the choice of partition is important and should reect the choices made in the planning process eg with regard to inventory redistribution if the increased interdaily variance on weekends for example is already known and accounted for in planning such that there are different schedules for redistribution then partitioning as we propose would be appropriate however if the general planning process including demand forecast and inventory optimisation assumes uniformity across all days of the week it would then be informative to do the same in the outlier detection to ag the weekend effect when it occurs 4 clustering stations by spatial usage patterns when outlier demand is driven by factors such as regional events or weather we expect it to affect more than a single isolated station at the same time we cannot assume that all stations experience outlier demand at the same time and in the same way therefore we rst cluster the stations such that those in the same cluster are likely to experience similar effects from demand outliers we propose a twostage process to determine which stations should be clustered first we construct a graph based on the geographic coordinates of the stations to determine which stations are permitted to be in the same cluster based on geographic distance secondly we follow an idea from zahn 1971 who suggests the removal of edges

openended than in situations where mobility networks rely on established legs as eg in the railway application studied in rennie 2021 for bikesharing direct journeys between any two stations are possible so that in theory all stations could be vertices in a fully connected graph although we could simply add edges between every node ie a complete graph there are two reasons for not doing so i for the purposes of aiding planning we do not want two stations which are geographically far apart to be in the same cluster if no stations in between are similar to both ii the algorithm used to compute the mst is slowed down by an increased number of edges and due to the greedy nature of it we are more likely to end up at a nonoptimal solution if we add in extraneous edges 41 graph construction from geographical distance we rst construct a graph where the nodes represent the stations and the edges indicate which stations are permitted to be in the same cluster this approach implicitly assumes that similarity of usage is driven by the stations geographical proximity that is if two stations are close together potential customers are more likely to treat them as interchangeable causing similar usage patterns in the capital bikeshare data set stations are more densely distributed in the centre of dc so that customers can choose from a large variety of stations we expect this to render them more sensitive to distance such that they are less willing to travel to a more distant station therefore we use different criteria to add an edge between stations depending on how close to the centre of dc those stations are to identify the dense citycentre we establish a circle around the centre of dc of radius r with the median co ordinates of all stations as the centre as shown in figure 6a with r 5000m we add an edge between stations i and j if i both stations lie inside the radius and are less than dinner apart or ii one or both stations lie outside the

the usage patterns of two stations are we add weights to the edges of the graph for each edge between stations i and j we also compute an edge weight representing the dissimilarity between the usage

spanning tree is a subgraph that includes all vertices in the original graph and a minimum number of edges such that the spanning tree is connected if the original graph is disconnected we compute a spanning tree for each component termed a spanning forest a minimum spanning tree mst is the spanning tree with the minimum sum of edge weights since the graph is weighted we use prims algorithm prim

centre branching into smaller clusters clearly the choice of threshold values impacts the precise clustering results the distance parameters r dinner douter also affect clustering the number of clusters increases as or r is increased whereas increasing dinner or douter has the opposite effect there is an inverse relationship between the number of clusters and the uniformity of cluster size as the number of clusters increases individual stations tend to split off to form their own cluster whilst the majority of stations remain in the large central cluster resulting in decreased uniformity of cluster size for decisionmaking clusters of similar sizes are often more informative compared to a large cluster consisting of most stations and the remaining stations each in their own cluster we leave the choice of parameters to analyst input such that analysts may use their expertise to select appropriate values based on the visualisation and their business case vock et al 2021

the varying threshold also indicates that the need for separate forecasting is more critical when considering a larger area ie when considering total demand but is less critical over smaller areas closer to the station level monitoring the difference in the number of clusters and the similarity of the two clusterings can help analysts to decide on the level of forecasting analysts could also examine changes in the nmi over time for a given correlation threshold for example if the pickup and dropoff clusterings are becoming more similar to each other over time this could indicate

of statistical depth in statistics depth provides an ordering of observations where those near the centre of the distribution have higher depth and those far from the centre have lower depth in the case where each observation is a time series of usage throughout the day the functional depth can measure how close to the central trajectory ie median usage pattern each daily usage pattern is therefore to measure the outlyingness of each daily usage pattern we calculate its functional depth with respect to other daily usage patterns that lie in the same partition of data days whose usage pattern has lower functional depth are more outlying in particular if the depth is below some threshold we classify the day as an outlier for each partition of data p and for each station s we

may be assigned to monitor dedicated clusters and this helps to identify which clusters may need more manual adjustments in addition to identifying patterns in figure 14 analysts could utilise this gure to nd changes in the outlier patterns for example changes in the distribution of outliers along the xaxis would suggest a change in the spatial demand pattern and could indicate a refresh of the clustering process is required changes in the distribution of outliers along the yaxis may indicate more or fewer outliers over time or if the new pattern is regular suggest that a variable is missing from the demand forecast changes in the colour of points may indicate that outliers are becoming more or less severe ie demand is becoming less or more predictable which could prompt a review of the forecasting and optimisation approached for example it could indicate that a more robust approach to optimisation is required if outliers are occurring more frequently or with higher severity 6 discussion in this section we discuss patterns in the outliers detected in the capital bikeshare data and suggest potential explanations for their causes figure 15 visualises the number of positive and negative outliers over the days of the time span recorded in the data set by visualising the positive and negative outliers jointly analysts can immediately see that i negative outliers typically affect far fewer clusters than positive outliers ii the spikes where outlier demand affects a large number of clusters do not occur at the same time for positive and negative outliers and iii the seasonal patterns in the detected outliers are not the same for positive and negative outliers this can aid analysts in their predictions of outliers though positive outliers are always more common

in fact only four days observe outliers in more than 125 of the 195 clusters one negative and three positive the three positive outliers occur on 25 march 2017 3 december 2018 and 30 march 2019

2019 were both warm days and the last saturday in march perhaps suggesting that the denition of summer should be from the last saturday in march rather than april 1 it is interesting to note that the next most widespread positive outlier relates to independence day in 2017 independence day was detected as a positive outlier in 123 80 and 35 clusters in 2017 2018 and 2019 however it was detected as a negative outlier in 46 47 and 57 stations respectively the date of the widespread negative outlier is 21 july 2018 which relates to one of the worst storms washington dc has seen further discussion of how weather is related to outliers can be found in section 62 61 spatiotemporal patterns in detected outliers in this section we analyse the detected outliers and consider spatial and temporal patterns within the outliers temporal patterns even after accounting for the lower means and reduced interdaily variance of the winter months we detect fewer outliers in winter indicated by the two horizontal white bars in figure 14 otherwise we nd no clear systematic temporal patterns to the detected outliers appendix a31 provides additional discussion on the temporal aspects of the detected outliers including the visible temporal patterns in the outliers when we fail to account for temporal patterns in the forecasting step however figure 16 shows that although outliers can sometimes occur as oneoff events they are also quite likely to occur in temporal clusters therefore once an outlier has been identied the information can be used to support adjustments to planning in the subsequent days spatial patterns next we discuss spatial patterns in the detected outliers and consider the relationship between outliers in pickup and dropoff usage patterns figure 14 shows that the cluster which is formed around the centre of washington dc indicated by the rst column on the left experiences more frequent and higher probability outliers otherwise there is little geographic pattern to how often outliers occur in terms of distance from the centre two other clusters besides the central dc cluster exhibit a higher number of outliers with higher severity than other clusters

when we look at outliers on a small cluster or station level there is less similarity between pickups and dropoffs however when the clusters are larger and the outliers aggregated there is a clearer

across the different clusters those closer to the centre of dc have a higher cosine similarity that is the closer a cluster is to the centre of dc the more likely it is that if a day is a pickup station cluster outlier it will also be a corresponding dropoff station cluster outlier we did not nd any temporal patterns in the comparison of pickup and dropoff outliers 62 weather as an explanatory factor for demand outliers it is widely acknowledged that weather can be used as a predictor for average bikesharing demand lin et al 2020 therefore we examine whether extreme temperature or rainfall drive extreme changes in demand ie outliers to that end we analyse weather data obtained from visual crossing 2021 and investigate whether weather can be used to explain and eventually

bottom left shows that a high proportion of days with a very low average daily temperatures 25 f are classied as outliers however these outliers typically have a low severity this can be explained by these outliers being negative demand outliers and low temperatures typically occur in winter when demand is already low in addition to temperature we also expect precipitation levels to affect demand for bikesharing as we expect increased rainfall to have a negative impact of usage we consider only the severity of negative demand outliers here figure 20b shows the proportion of days with a minimal level of precipitation which were classied as outliers with some severity higher rainfall generally results in higher likelihood of the day being classed as a negative demand outlier when precipitation levels are especially high the outliers that are detected also tend to have higher severities there are likely many other factors which cause and inuence outlier demand in the capital bikeshare network for example ma et al 2015 have previously linked usage of bikesharing stations to usage of metrorail services 20 a preprint we anticipate that cancellations or shortterm changes to

partitioning to remove such trends and obtain a homogeneous data set we also accounted for spatial patterns in temporal usage by clustering together similar stations by basing our clustering algorithm on a combination of geographical knowledge and similarity of usage patterns we were able to identify how usage changes as stations get further away from the city centre throughout this paper we have presented visualisations to illustrate our ndings and provided detailed descriptions of how such visualisations may be used by analysts to aid in their decision making our indepth study of detected outliers showed that not all stations are equally prone to outliers those closest to the centre of dc exhibit far more outlying demand this is also true for known outlier days eg national holidays such as july 4 where some clusters of stations exhibit increased demand and others decreased for forecasting and planning purposes this knowledge is highly important since outlier demand changes not only the magnitude of demand but also the spatial distribution of where customers go in terms of rebalancing bikes at stations this could have a large impact on the efciency of the schedule further we also showed that outliers are more likely to occur in the summer months even after accounting for increased usage and usage variability suggesting rebalancing needs to be more reactive in the summer months our analysis of weather patterns showed that outliers are more likely to occur when the weather conditions are more extreme both temperature and precipitation were found to have an impact on demand with excessively high precipitation or very low temperatures causing negative demand outliers and high temperatures causing positive demand outliers further research is needed to evaluate the effects that identifying and correcting for outliers may have on revenue and planning in the bikesharing domain this could include considering the impact of forecast accuracy on reallocation and revenue and the costbenet relationship that may result from making a change to the forecast to account for outlier demand the method outlined in this paper could be used to generate an outlier alert to notify capital bikeshare when the rebalancing policy for a given day is nonoptimal online detection of outlier demand would allow reallocation of bikes during the day and as such further analysis of how these alerts could be deployed in an automated system and how they may affect the complexity of the routing problem is needed a further extension could consider how outlier detection may be applied to dockless bikesharing systems where users may pickup or dropoff a bike anywhere rather than at dedicated stations similar methodology could be applied in this case though an additional preprocessing step would be required where regions are dened all pickups or dropoffs within a single region would then be treated in the same way as a single station these regions may be dened based on knowledge of the underlying city geography or by applying spatial clustering methods 8 data availability statement the datasets analysed during this study are available from capital bikeshare in a

we perform model comparison for the functional regression model used to account for different daily trends as detailed in section 3 equation 1 we use the crossvalidated mean integrated squared error cvmse to determine the besttting model the cvmse is given by cv mse 1 n n x n1 z xnst xnstdt 6 where xnst is the prediction for the nth daily rental pattern at the station s under the model tted to all but the nth rental pattern the model which produces the lowest cvmse is chosen as the best tting unlike other model selection criterion such aic cvmse does not take into account the number of

skewed a14 accounting for skewness figure 25a shows the distribution of the normalised total daily usage for station 31235 which exhibits positive skew not all stations exhibit such positively skewed distributions see figure 24 the distributions of total daily usage have a skewness lying between 04 and 158 with the median skewness across all stations being 071 larger positive skew is more common in stations where mean usage is very low and since demand is bounded below by zero only increases in demand are observed this results in more positive outliers than negative see section 6 given that most stations exhibit slight positive skew it may be desirable to transform the data before performing outlier detection to account for the skew the rental patterns can rst be transformed eg with a logarithmic transform however this is not applicable to all stations as some are already negatively skewed and can result in a negatively skewed distribution figure 25 when applying the outlier detection procedure to the untransformed data the fraction of positive outliers is consistently higher than the fraction of negative outliers on average 78 of outliers are positive that is outliers are more likely to be caused by increased demand than decreased this is easily explained by the fact that demand is bounded below by 23 a preprint 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

the balance of the different cluster sizes we do not seek to minimise nor maximise the sdcs since choosing extreme parameter values trivially creates clusters of size 1 or one giant cluster figure 28 shows the change in number of clusters and sdcs as we vary parameter values there is an inverse relationship between the number of clusters and the sdcs across all four variables while an increase in either correlation threshold or radius results in a decrease of sdcs increasing either of the distance thresholds increases the sdcs in order to achieve a balance between number of clusters and sdcs

outlier detection for a homogeneous data set we would expect approximately equal numbers of outliers detected on each day of the week and month of the year figure 29 shows the difference between the

model is applied with no partitioning iii only partitioning is applied with no regression and iv both regression and partitioning is applied when we do not account for temporal patterns in the data we detect far more outliers on weekends and in the summer months including the regression step without partitioning improves this imbalance somewhat when the data has been partitioned regression makes little difference to the proportion of outliers detected on each day or month although we partition the data to account for,"[101, 1014, 3263, 4278, 5174, 1014, 2322, 2871, 3438, 2184, 5709, 4002,

provides people with a sustainable mode of transportation and has benecial eects for both the environment and the user and the citywide accessibility and low cost has exponentially increased its popularity nonetheless the increased usage has led to create issues like unavailability of bikes and docks at bike stations therefore the study aims to predict the demands of a bike sharing system using machine learning models and also analyses comprehensive eect of the time dependent and interstation relationship on predicting the demands the metro bikeshare data of 2019 consisting of more than 2 million records of bikes trip was used in the research the original data les lacked the demand attributes required for the research and demanded extensive data processing and transformation

resolving the inclusion of new bike station in the system and performed well 1 introduction the increased usage of private vehicles in metropolitan areas has resulted in a signicant rise in fuel consumptions that have adverse eects on the climate it has led people in todays society to accept problems like road trac as the norm therefore the govern ment and organizations started adopting measures to facilitate sustainable development to address the issue in that context the bike share initiative was launched to tackle the public mobility problem it provided the people with an alternative to using a sus tainable mode of transport for a small distance at a minimal cost and gave people the freedom to utilize the service by themselves in a bikeshare system a user could lend a bike from any bike stations and return it to a bike station near the destination and since it involves the activity of pedalling the bike it has benecial health eects and the citywide installation of bike stations improved the accessibility of areas by bikes however the popularity of the bikeshare system increased drastically which led to creating a gap between the supply and demands of bikes and docks at bike stations and the most common issues faced by the users are the lack of bikes and docks available at bike stations the growing concern led the bike operators to consider the matter seriously and 1 to develop strategies to dissipate the issue the initial strategies implemented truck usage to move the bikes from one bike station to another to solve the issue of unavailability the strategy was widely analysed in several studies to provide an appropriate implementation plan while it was found to be successful for nighttime maintenance operations the underlying purpose of solving daytime issues was not accomplished since then the objective to resolve the unavailability issue has been widely examined in many studies but many of those studies produced qualitative results due to the lack of dependent features in the available data few empirical studies have manipulated the bike share data to derive the desired features and to present quantitative results by utilizing the historic records of bike trips and external factors that aect the system in addition very limited few have examined the impact of nearby bike stations on the availability of a particular bike station the task of assessing both the interstation eects and the timevarying data has been an ordeal to analyze using standard methods but the recent introduction of new methodologies has made it possible to evaluate both the factors to comment on the availability issue therefore the fundamental aim of the research is to predict the demands in a bike share system using machine learning methods and the secondary objective is to analyse the collective interstation and timevarying eect on predicting the demands for a bike station to address the research objectives widely used models related to the study autoregressive integrated moving average arima model and long shortterm memory lstm model are included in the study and to evaluate the second objective spatial temporal,"[101, 29304, 1996,

interval data 30 min and 60 min respectively the comparison of the model for short interval indicated that performance of stgcn model outer performed the other models with mse of 074 12 and 0094 for both bikes and docks demand the results obtained by the stgcn model were comparatively better then the results obtained by the multigraph convolution model framework in kim et al 2019 for a bike share network thus implying the eectiveness of incorporating neighbouring stations as a factor for prediction lstm model was also quite eective in forecasting demands and provided a balanced result for both bikes and docks it also veried the works that proposed the lstm models superiority for precisely determining forecasts than the arima model siaminamini et al 2018 the better performance of stgcn than tagcn model inferred that the gcnconv layer kipf and welling 2016 was more eective in assigning weights to edges for the metro bikeshare data figure 7 stgcn model bikes and docks demand prediction for 60 min interval but for the long interval a similar trend of increased error rates was observed for all the models however for this scenario the lstm was found to be more eective than the rest the increased mse with the increase of interval size can be associated to the high variation of demands present in the adjacent intervals and it can be observed from gure 7 that while the stgcn model is capable of stimulating short uctuations in demand consecutive large uctuations are still out of scope a similar pattern was observed for tagcn in gure 8 and even though tagcn produced low mse its predictive capability was found to be poor it can also be concluded that increasing the interval size increases the variance between the intervals making it dicult to predict demands figure 8 tagcn model bikes and docks demand prediction for 60 min interval 13 6 conclusion and future work this study proposed the use machine learning techniques to identify the demands in a bikesharing system the study utilised the conventional arima and lstm model along with stgcn and tagcn model predict demands moreover the application of stgcn and tagcn also calculated the adjacent bike stations eects on the another bike stations demand characterstics the demands were obtained for twotime intervals 30 min and 60 min and the res ults for those intervals concluded that the demand frequency varies signicantly in long intervals nding it challenging for machine learning models to work eectively neverthe less if the data is individually analyzed for each bike station then from past records other demand characteristics can be dened to forecast demands like the lstm model on the other hand the frequency of demands is widely distributed in short interval which facilitates the models ability to predict accurate demands for the succeeding interval therefore the stgcn model that considers interstation dependence and timevarying characteristics was comparatively more ecient in obtaining demands close to the actual value to further increase the performance of the models external parameters can be in cluded which aects the bike usage moreover imitating,"[101, 13483, 2951, 2382, 8117, 1998,

type of transportation service that provides bicycles for shared use they allow users to rent a bicycle at one station ride it and return it to another station in the same city in this paper the author the trip data of shanghai mobike in august 2016 are taken as the main raw data and the trip characteristics of shared bicycle system are deeply studied by using data mining method and the arima model is used to predict bicycle trip finally rmse is used to judge the prediction accuracy the results show that the model can effectively predict the residents trip and the prediction accuracy is high which can provide a certain reference for residents trip keywords sharing bicycles arima prediction time series travel characters i introduction the public bicycles system pbs which originated in europe began to enter china in 2007 and began to pilot in large cities such as beijing hangzhou and wuhan and gradually expanded to other provincial capital cities and small and mediumsized cities the operation of the public bicycles system formally integrates bicycles into the field of public transport seamlessly butt the slow traffic and public transport and crack the last kilometre problem at the end of the traffic and achieve a better city with low carbon travel in 2012 the ministry of housing and construction issued the guidelines for the planning and design of urban walking and bicycle traffic systems by 2016 the total amount of public bicycles in china has reached about 500000 exceeding the total of other countries in the world with the rapid development of the internet the application of mobile internet technology has been paid more and more attention in the past two years the sharing economy or sharing economy has been developing in full swing the typical

demand for consumption in this study based on the arima model the data of mobike trip in shanghai and the location of the site are used to forecast the demand at present there are also some problems in the operation of the sharing bicycles system in shanghai for example the number of sites in the densely populated area is not enough to meet the needs of the residents to borrow and return the car because of the tide phenomenon there will be a twoway flow imbalance in the peak period of the morning and evening and the demand for a few stations in a single direction is large in the other direction there is a large demand for parking and some sites appear empty users can not borrow cars some sites are full of full status users can not return the car the site of the demand for vehicles depends on artificial experience lack of platform data support intelligent management level to be improved iii source of data the original data in this paper come from two parts one is take from

out in person and collected in person the subjects of the survey are residents of the city divided into the use of shared bicycles and nonuse of the two groups of people targeted design of two types of questionnaires a total of 1347 valid questionnaires were collected including 1205 for shared bicycles and 142 for nonusers the questionnaire for the purpose of sharing bicycle trip is which of the following purposes do you use shared bike for multiple options shopping dining and entertainment exercise commute to and from work go on a tripothers from the results of the questionnaire commuting and shopping are the two main purposes of trip table 1 questionnaire iv model and procedure a arima model the arima model is called autoregressive integral moving average model which is a famous time series prediction method proposed by box and jenkins in the early 1970s12 so its also called the boxjenkins model and the boxesjenkins method the arima p d q called differential autoregressive moving average model ar is the number of differences made when autoregressive p is the autoregressive term and ma is the moving average term and d is the time series when the time series becomes stationary 5 the socalled arima model is the model that transforms the non stationary time series into the stationary time series and then regresses the dependent variable only to its lag value and the present value and the lag value of the random error term the arima model includes moving average process ma autoregressive process ar autoregressive moving average process arma and arima process according to whether the original sequence is stationary or not the characteristic of arima model is that the change of other correlated random variables is not directly considered but the data sequence formed by the prediction object over time is treated as a random sequence and the random sequence can be generated by the autoregressive moving average process that is the time series can be explained by its own past value or lag value and random disturbance term if the time series is stable that is its behavior does not change significantly over time it can predict future values through the past and present values of the time series arima model can effectively deal with autocorrelation nonstationary data so this paper uses arima model to predict the demand of bicycle in the short term which can help users to know how many vehicles will be borrowed or returned in the future then according to this information to decide whether to rent or return to other sites second to enable the management to accurately grasp the site bicycle rental situation so as to effectively allocate the site of the actual vehicle b modeling process the basic process of forecasting the trip demand of shared bicycle stations by establishing arima p d q model the flows were explained in detail as follows drawing time sequence diagram to judge whether there is a clear trend or period that is to identify the stationary for the nonstationary time series data the dorder,"[101, 2041, 1999, 2711, 1998, 5067, 1999, 2711, 1996, 5739, 1997, 1996, 5002, 2024, 3901, 1997, 1996, 2103, 4055, 2046, 1996, 2224, 1997,

complexity of the model plays a role so the model with a small number of parameters is a better choice in general when the complexity of the model increases k increases the likelihood function l also increases which makes the aic become smaller but when k is too large the growth rate of likelihood function slows down leading to the increase of aic and the model is too complex to cause the phenomenon of overfitting the goal is to select the model with the smallest aic not only to improve the model fitting degree maximum likelihood but also to introduce a penalty term so that the model parameters are as few as possible which will help to reduce the possibility of overfitting bic similar to aic is used for model selection which was proposed by schwarz in 1978 when training the model increasing the number of parameters that is increasing the complexity of the model will increase the likelihood function but it will also lead to the phenomenon of overfitting in order to solve the problem both aic and bic introduce penalty terms related to the number of parameters of the model the penalty term of bic is larger than that of aic when the number of samples is too large it can effectively prevent the model complexity caused by too high model precision ln 2ln 5 where k is the number of model parameters n is the number of samples and l is the likelihood function ln is penalty

estimate the systems demand an extensive review of the bikesharing research published from 2010 to 2018 concludes that demand estimation is one of the most evolutionary trends in the field of bikesharing research globally si et al 2019 in the literature there are many studies which attempt to identify factors that affect stations demand according to the united states department of transportation 2012 stations demand is correlated with a population density b employment density c proximity to universities d commercial activity density e available bicycle infrastructure f proximity to tourist attractions and recreation areas g available public transit h topography the impact of these factors on station demand is explored further in other surveys zhao et al 2015 use data from nanjing china and identify that the demand for bikesharing trips is mainly generated in residential areas and is mainly attracted by rail stations noland et al 2016 use bayesian regression models and conclude that stations close to subway stations and bicycle infrastructure exhibit higher demand apart from the bicycle infrastructure the presence of neighboring bikesharing stations has significant impact on the station usage hyland et al 2018 another study highlights that demand is lower in areas with higher elevation faghihimani et al 2017 the factors mentioned above to affect station demand are related to the built environment land uses and transport systems and can therefore be useful information for the optimal planning of bikesharing systems that is the determination of the number the location and the capacity of the stations however for the proper management of the system and more specifically for the redistribution of bicycles it is useful to estimate the change in demand of a station within the year even the day kim 2018 identifies that demand for bikesharing trips is approximately the same on weekends and weekdays but lower during public holidays and during days with high temperatures weather variables such as temperature wind intensity rainfall and humidity level found to be important predictors also in ashqar et al 2019 and corcoran et al 2014 studies recent studies apply machine learning techniques in order to develop tools for short term prediction of demand at station level hulot et al 2018 wang and kim 2018 lozano et al 2018 lin et al 2018 these studies mainly exploit temporal and weather data and apply methods such as random forests gradient boosting and recurrent and graph convolutional neural networks the aim of the present paper is to present a methodology for the development of a tool as well as the tool itself which consists of a demand prediction model and a webbased application visualizing the predictions in contrast with other predictive models developed in this field the model proposed in this paper focuses on smallmedium sized systems and is intended to be easily adaptable to the needs and characteristics of different bikesharing systems of similar size as such and this is also an innovation of the tool for every system neofytos boufidis et al transportation research procedia 47 2020 5158 53 boufidis et

several machine learning regression algorithms are tested and evaluated and the user the bikesharing systems operator is provided with the results of the bestfitting algorithm such a tool could comprise a useful assistance for bikesharing operators in order to optimize bikes redistribution process and offer reliable services to the systems users 2 methodology the developed prediction tool is based on a data driven model that fuses data from three different sources a static file with information and the location coordinates of the bikesharing system stations the rental records database of the system which includes spatial and temporal data for both the start and end of each rental and weather data for the area where the system operates as well as short term weather forecast three different time intervals for model training and issuing predictions are considered namely 1hour 2hour and 3hour for systems with high rental density the one or twohour intervals are considered more meaningful and suitable however when analyzing systems with sparse rental frequency it might be the case that different stations have very few or even 0 rentals for the vast majority of short intervals in such cases increasing the time interval to 3 hours is a countermeasure after the desired time interval is selected an efficient algorithm groups rentals records according to trip start station and counts the rentals within each selected temporal interval to create the dependent target variable for the demand predictive algorithms a similar method is applied for the bike returns predictive model however the grouping is implemented with respect to the station where each trip has ended so that the target variable is the number of bikes returned at each station for each time interval for both models the rest of the processing steps is identical the weather and rental datasets are resampled to matching time intervals for each time interval sample four weather features are extracted from the weather database a average temperature b wind speed c sky cover ordinal numeric variable representing clear scattered broken overcast and obscured conditions and d liquid precipitation the final data preprocessing step is feature engineering methods applied to raw data in order to create custom independent variables to be utilized by the model the tool automatically extracts several such variables from the date and time of each interval two binary variables indicate whether the day is a holiday or a sunday respectively an important feature because bike demand is typically differentiated during such days the time weekday and month of each time interval are encoded in a cyclical fashion considering a day a week and a year as complete circles respectively for example a week circle consists of n7 weekdays represented as n0 1 2 6 and each of them is mapped to its corresponding angle of 2pin7 rad and is coded to the tuple sincos consecutive weekdays are mapped to angles with the minimum difference of 2pi7 rad and thus coded to tuples with small sine and cosine numerical difference unlike inconsecutive weekdays finally an ordinal variable encodes the year and is useful for systems,"[101, 2195, 3698, 4083, 26237, 13792, 2024, 7718, 1998, 16330, 1998, 1996, 5310, 1996, 18105, 18428, 3070, 3001, 6872, 2003, 3024, 2007, 1996, 3463, 1997, 1996, 2190,

that operate for prolonged period of times and demand might change over the years per station demand and returns of a bss might also be affected by the number of available bikes to rent in nearby stations in the case when a station is empty the demand in nearby stations might increase furthermore according to each bss policy a full station might not accept bikes in such scenarios the number of bikes returned to nearby stations is expected to increase in the developed predictive model the state of nearby stations was not utilized as an independent variable due to data limitations the historical dataset utilized for the case study consists of the rental records data for redistributed bikes are not available thus the number of bikes per station at any point in time is unknown the

thessaloniki nikiforiadis and basbas 2019 while the citys environment is judged by the citizens as unsafe and uncomfortable for cycling vaitsis et al 2019 the bicycle lanes network currently operating in thessaloniki has a total length of 1173 km and does not provide sufficient accessibility to bicycle users nevertheless it is estimated that this situation will change in the near future through appropriate interventions resulting from the implementation of the sustainable urban mobility plan sump which is conducted by the local authority in the city of thessaloniki a bikesharing system named

data the weather dataset used records the average wind speed and temperature for the previous 30 minutes sky clearance report for the last 3 hours and precipitation levels for the last 6 and 24 hours the precipitation values were normalized as hourly values to enable correct resampling in any of the desired temporal intervals of 1 2 or 3 hours the rental dataset includes the rent and return timestamp and station for each rental another two variables include the user and bike id analysis on this dataset reveals that almost 25 of rentals have a duration up to 5 minutes according to the bike sharing operator such trips should be considered invalid and therefore were excluded from further analysis furthermore data for 2013 were excluded from the training set because demand during this initial period of system operation was very low as fig 2a confirms as a final preprocessing step each day is considered to have an 18hour duration from 60000 am to 235959 pm because the main rental

tool as described in section 2 was tested with data from the bss that operates in the city of thessaloniki the temporal aggregation level chosen for the tests is the 3hour interval the 1hour and 2hour levels were also investigated but were considered inappropriate for the bike sharing system of thessaloniki as many stations produce 0 rentals for the majority of time intervals the application of crossvalidation on the four predictive models revealed that xgboost outperformed the rest of the models by some margin however the performance of all models converged when the optimized hyperparameter values obtained by the gscv were utilized the random forest and gradient boosting models appear to fit the train set better than the other algorithms with lower errors and higher r2 values as table 1 indicates however a models predictive performance and generalization ability is more accurately assessed on a test dataset a subset of the data that was not used during the model training on the test set gradient boosting produces marginally less errors compared to the rest of the models a final important comment on the evaluation results is that the neural network model produces similar results on both the train and test set it clearly has the worst fit for the train set however on 56 neofytos boufidis et al transportation research procedia 47 2020 5158 6 boufidis et al transportation

for rentals and returns of bikes for stationbased bike sharing schemes and visualizing the results is presented the tool facilitates a simple intuitive interface that requires no special training or expertise and can be utilized by any bikesharing system operator after receiving and harvesting the historical bike rental dataset it automatically produces the best performing algorithm for rental demand and return forecasting for all stations of the system the level of model appropriateness is reported to the user along with a detailed report of the predictive performance of the different algorithms after the model evaluation the tooluser opts for the desired time interval for issuing predictions ie 1 2 or 3 hours the produced results are visualized on an interactive userfriendly environment in realtime supporting the operators in decision making and datadriven management of their fleet and stations the developed tool empowers the management of bikesharing systems enabling accurate datadriven decisions to optimize the systems operation and it can provide very useful insight for the development of strategies incentivizing users to returnrent bicycles fromto specific stations according to expected demand future work will deploy the demand prediction output of this tool to develop an optimal bicycles redistribution tool to support bikesharing systems operation

framework to solve the dynamic bikesharing repositioning problem based on four core models a demand forecasting model a station inventory model a redis tribution needs model and a vehiclerouting model the approach is proactive instead of reactive as bike repositioning occurs before inefciencies are observed the framework is tested using data from the hubway bikesharing system simulation results indicate that system performance improvements of 7 are achieved reducing the number of empty and full events by 57 and 76 respectively during pm peaks published by elsevier ltd 1 introduction bikesharing is a sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation mode that offers bikes ondemand to improve daily urban mobility a typical current bikesharing system operates as follows a member can pick up a bike from any of the stations available in the system and must return it before a predened time period to any other station that has empty docks available stations have a xed capacity and a time limit is imposed to ensure high bike usage and bike rotation bikesharing systems compete with other forms of public transportation in urban environments in the united states as of 2012 there were 15 itbased bikesharing programs shaheen et al 2012 and major us cities such as new york san francisco chicago forth worth or columbus launched their own bikesharing programs during 2013 similar trends are observed around the world meddin and demaio 2007 shaheen et al 2012 although bikesharing systems potentially offer a viable alternative for enhancing urban mobility they suffer from the effects of uctuating spatial and temporal demand that inherently lead to severe system inefciencies eg having empty or full stations for long periods of time these inefciencies are embedded in the fabric of bikesharing because oneway trips are allowed and the operator has little control over the behavior of the users as a result some stations are empty and some others are full impeding potential users to either pick up or drop off bikes at their desired stations degrading the level of service system performance and causing disappointment that may result in loss of users to resolve these inefciencies bikesharing operators are compelled to reposition bikes dynamically to avoid the system from collapsing fricker et al 2012 it has also been demonstrated that knowledge of future demands can aid in these repositioning tasks reducing relo cation costs and increasing the system performance barth and todd 1999 httpdxdoiorg101016jtre201410005 13665545published by elsevier ltd

a station inven tory model 3 a redistribution needs model and 4 a vehicle routing model the dynamic bikesharing rebalancing problem can be seen as a onecommodity pickupanddelivery vehicle routing problem 1pdtsp hernandezperez and salazargonzalez 2004 with the added complexity that the inventory at the sta tions is exible schuijbroek et al 2013 we see the methodology presented in the paper as an heuristic to solve such a problem that on its core uses anticipated future demands to decouple the inventory and the routing problem reducing the complexity making it scalable proactive instead of reactive and allowing for real time decisionmaking vehicle routes are built dynamically based on current and expected events in a proactive manner as inefciencies are resolved before they actually occur increasing customer satisfaction as routes are being built periodically operator interaction is permitted overriding current routing decisions the routing problem maximizes the utility gained by removing inefciencies from the system it is selective not all sta tions are visited keeps track of the vehicle inventory can handle a nonhomogenous eet and allows for pick ups or drop offs at buffering stationsstations that are in a balanced state but some bikes can be removed or added without causing future inefcienciessolving the issue of having an empty or full vehicle that is not able to respond to existing inefciencies the proposed predictive model has the potential to help determine more efcient userbased relocation policies by means of incentives or dynamic pricing policies it is also selfadaptive as it is regularly retrained as new system data are being acquired further enhancements to the predictive module can be made if bikesharing system users data were available for example offering discounts to users that express the need of a bike at a given station using a mobile application doing so can improve the predictive model and lead to better routing decisions although the models developed in this paper pertain specically to the dynamic rebalancing problem in bikesharing the general framework has application in dynamic logistics resource operations and management in various other demandsup ply operational scenarios eg directly in the balancing of electric vehicles in the zevnet shareduse station car system city of irvine 2014 or with some modication to the problem of distribution of emergency medical personnel by type of specialty in such disasters as earthquakes and hurricanes furthermore models developed on the framework could also be implemented to efciently distribute vehicles in a hypothetical oneway carsharing system using a eet of autonomous vehicles the framework has been tested under various simulation scenarios with variable time steps using data from the hubway bikesharing system in boston hubway 2011 the simulation results show that level of service can be improved compared to the do nothing scenario especially in reducing the observed number of full and empty events managerial decisions are also simulated testing for the impact of the number and the capacity of the vehicles used for rebalancing operations

forecasting future demands in shared ride systems and approaches to formulate and solve the dynamic bikesharing rebalancing problem concerning forecasting future demands a variety of techniques have been explored initial insights can be found in the carsharing literature which has a longer history of investigation barth and todd 1999 show under a simulation framework that for a oneway carsharing system the knowledge of future demands signicantly impacts performance measures four different predictive techniques are tested on real data from the honda intelligent community vehicle system icvs in

predictive power when those factors are included gebhart and noland 2013 study the impact of weather on trips made at capital bikeshare in washington dc considering the precise weather conditions when the trip is made and conclude that fewer trips are made in rainy humid windy and cold conditions another common assumption is that the same explanatory variables work for all stations meaning that the same model can be used to make forecasts for individual stations however our tests indicate that in bikesharing systems the behavior of the stations is extremely dynamic and that behavior need not be correlated among them as a result either a variable selec tion step specic to each station should be introduced or the predictive technique should internally account for that additionally most of the current predictive models do not attempt to be used as inputs to the bikesharing rebalancing problem but rather attempt either to explain bikesharing usage and riders behavior borgnat et al 2011

the day reducing the cost of the dynamic repositioning a different approach to determine optimal inventory levels is presented in lu 2013 a bikesharing system is represented using a timespace network ow model and the goal is to minimize the system total cost including holding cost at station bike supply costs redistribution costs and the cost of losing customers due to unmet demand the solution to the problem is the optimal bike allocation and the redistribution ows to account for demand uncertainty robust optimization techniques are introduced numerical tests are carried out using the bikesharing system in banciao district in new taipei city taiwan schuijbroek et al 2013 combine both the inventory and the routing problems into a single framework optimal inven tory levels are rst estimated from historical data each station is individually modeled as a mm1k queuing model the inventory is then fed to the routing problem minimizing the maximum tour length of the vehicles the problem is solved in a rolling horizon fashion using a clusterrst routesecond heuristic the model performance is tested on the hubway and capital bikeshare bikesharing systems from boston and washington respectively caggiani and ottomanelli 2013 also address both problems proposing a decision support system that considers stochas tic demand and minimizes vehicle reposition cost the day is divided into xed time intervals at the beginning of each time interval future demands are updated and the decision support system is launched the outputs of the model are the reloca tion matrix and the relocation path of the redistribution vehicles that minimize the total operator costs including relocation costs and lost users costs the model is tested on a 5station bikesharing system discretizing the day into 5min intervals under three different demand scenarios the results indicate that signicant reductions of lost users can be achieved pfrommer et al 2013 use modelbased receding

consists of nding heuristics that can quickly nd a nearoptimal solution to the routing problem for a given time period here we propose a different approach to reduce the complexity of the problem building on the idea of proactive dynamic vehicle routing ferrucci 2013 and the use of machine learning techniques we rst combine different datasets to infer future station inventory levels based on the inferred inventory levels a stochastic linear integer problem is solved to deter mine the estimated number of bikes required at the stations with inefciencies once pickup and drop off events are iden tied they are treated as deterministic and are the input to a vehicle routing model that optimally routes vehicles based on anticipated events the vehicle routing problem is solved for a single vehicle at a time and is limited to those stations that have inefciencies and are within threshold distance of the current station bounding the size of the problem and allowing the use of traditional solvers to nd a solution the proposed proactive vehicle routing approach differs from current proactive routing approaches such as the hybrid predictive control nez et al 2013 or the realtime control and requestforecasting ferrucci 2013 the previous approaches focus on real time deliveries and paratransit type problems and incorporate into the objective function expected future events vehicles are routed through areas with higher probabilities for events to occur in future time steps so that when an event occurs vehicles are able to respond faster in our approach we also include this idea into the objective func tion but the bikesharing rebalancing problem requires the solution of an inventory model rst therefore we not only use future expected demands in the routing problem but also to anticipate inventory needs successfully combining machine learning techniques with mathematical programming in this manner we have a truly proactive approach as vehicles are routed before the events occur not only focusing on minimizing the routing costs because the vehicles are closer to an event that is about to happen 3 framework the framework we propose has four main models 1 a demand forecasting model at the station level 2 a station inven tory model 3 a redistribution needs model and 4 a vehicle routing model the relationship between the various models and the available data in most newgeneration bikesharing systems is shown in fig 1 dashed boxes represent available data that serves as an input to the models historical data is fed into the demand forecasting model and the inventory levels model by historical data we refer to the inventory level time series prior to the current time and other such related data as weather and transit data that may improve the accuracy of the forecasting model the goal of the forecasting model is to anticipate inventory levels at different time windows from the current time for example after 20 40 and 60 min based on current system states the inventory levels model uses historical data to deter mine the optimal initial inventory level such that in the next time period next 20 min,"[101, 3774, 1997, 1050, 4667, 2002, 9496, 10074,

to outliers furthermore variable selection is internalized in the decision tree making the algorithm robust toward irrelevant input variables and there is no need to impute missing values since the decision tree can also handle them also overtting is avoided by carefully selecting the regularization parameters learning rate m and number of iterations m another advantage is that there is no need to retrain the entire model when new data are acquired as the boosting procedure can continue from the previous model saving computational time and making gbm attractive for online applications

visiting buffering stations if a penalty were not added vehicles may be routed through buffering stations without any need to we normalize the travel time by the maximum travel time permitted ttmax which in our problem equals 20 min and we introduce a coefcient c to change the relative importance of the penalty for example setting c to ttmax makes the penalty one order of magnitude larger than the other utility terms meaning that if there is any other alternative rather than visiting a buffering station independent of the magnitude of the inefciency the buffering station will not be visited we have tested for the sensitivity of c in the numerical examples constraint 1 ensures the routing is completed by the next simulation time constraints 2 to 7 take care of the routing constraints 2 and 3 ensure that the vehicle leaves the depot its location at the start of the period and that it will not come back to it in later time steps k constraint 4 enforces that only one trip per time step is allowed constraint 5 is the connectivity constraint and we also enforce that stations cannot be revisited in 6 constraints 810 keep track of vehicle load and make sure that more bikes than the ones available are not dropped off or that vehicle capacity is not exceeded constraint 11 forces buffering stations to be transshipment nodes and constraint 12 does not allow buffering stations to be demand nodes constraints 13 and 14 set the bounds on zk h if the corresponding buffering station is visited problem p2 can be infeasible a condition that occurs most frequently when the travel time constraint is violated because the vehicle does not have either enough bikes or empty spaces to serve an inefciency and has to rst visit a buffering station to either pick up or drop off bikes under such circumstance the vehicle remains idle at its current station the idle time is set to 10 min in current simulation scenarios note that p2 is not formulated as a multiperiod problem that uses information from previous models regarding future time steps in other words uj is dened using only the estimated inefciencies for the rst time window the underlying reasons to do so are because there is a trade off to be made which is due to the accuracy of the predictions and because future information is already accounted for when solving p1 to determine the inefciencies for the rst time window

accurate a heuristic would be needed to make sure that current routes are the best routes possible given current up to date information instead of proposing such heuristic and the more complex multiperiod problem we have opted by solving p2 more frequently with more recent information in addition the current approach may be more appealing and exible from an operational perspective as it is likely more responsive to reroutings implemented by the operations center and can better capture the true travel times observed from the network in real time given that travel times can be obtained every time a tour ends limited to 20 min rather than after the 3 periods limited to 60 min if information from previous models were used to demonstrate the impact of the utility terms in the objective

at other stations are larger other stations are not visited because the vehicle does not have enough bikes and it does not have time to go through a buffering station in scenario 2 instead when

r regue w recker transportation research part e 72 2014 192209 in order to update the state of the system based on the rebalancing events an assumption about how to treat the latent demand is needed this is because we are limited in the application of the models to existing hubway data rather than to outputs from a realtime closed loop control system under actual operation for demonstration purposes we consider here that one hour after the relocation event has occurred the demand or number of bikes will be the same as that observed in the original hubway dataset note that this assumption may lead to sudden jumps in the number of bikes observed in a sta tion and therefore trigger a relocation event note also that in a realtime online scenario this assumption is not needed as the input to the forecasting model would be the current state of the system 5 simulation results and discussion to demonstrate the potential of the modeling framework to improve current system performance we

from the table it can be observed that the system performance was already at sysperfb 9016 and after the relocation operation it was boosted sysperfinc 684 and 602 using gbm and lr respectively1 under the random case the system performances is degraded which demonstrates the ability of the predictive model to anticipate events if we look at the relative performance regarding empty and full events using gbm we are able to decrease the num ber of empty and full events by 57 and 76 respectively note that empty events performance is signicantly increased under gbm due to the ability to better predict empty events furthermore the total duration of empty and full events was reducedby 46 and 44 respectivelyas well as the average duration per empty eventaverage decrease from 30 min to 17 min per eventand the average duration per full eventaverage decrease from 39 min to 21 min per event a second more extensive set of simulations was run for the time period from 830 to 2130 for an entire

addressed are the remaining inefciencies that the operator was not able to handle 2 under the scenario in which vehicles can visit buffering stations the overall results are not sensitive to the

vehicles remain idle as the eet size increases as shown by the average miles traveled per vehicle per day for the case of 1 or 2 vehicles they travel on average about 100 miles per day whereas as eet

at around 20 min for 4 and 5 vehicles even with 5 vehicles the system cannot be projected to full performance using the pro active approach which is not surprising due to the inaccuracies inherent to the predictions fig 7 shows the trends in performance with gradually increasing the vehicle capacity and initial load of the two vehicles which is set at half of the vehicle capacity as can be observed all performance measures remain relatively unaffected by the vehicle capacity fig 8 depicts the results for a varying c similarly to what occurs when changing vehicle capacity performance measures remain relatively at only showing incremental increases when c 0 it can also be noted that when c 0 the miles traveled per day per vehicle are minimum as well as the mean duration of full events this behavior can be explained because if the penalty is not imposed on visiting buffering stations larger inefciencies that require visiting buffering stations have pref erence towards smaller inefciencies that do not require visiting buffering stations larger inefciencies tend to be related with longer and pick up events as the range ci smax it is often larger than the range smin it 0 fig 2 furthermore if a vehicle goes through a buffering station fewer stations with inefciencies are visited due to the travel time constraint overall because fewer stations with inefciencies are visited the system performance is reduced but miles traveled and mean dura tion of full events decreases a conclusion that could be drawn from these simple results is that from an operational perspective a better strategy for increasing system performance independent of the costs would be to use more vehicles with smaller capacities rather than fewer vehicles with greater capacity and set c to a value of 5 as a compromise solution between system performance and travel time this result is intuitive for this particular application of the methodology to the hubway dataset since the former strategy affords greater exibility in addressing what likely are relatively small residual system inefciencies in an oper ation that has already been tuned to be efcient by the system operators fig 8

the bikesharing repositioning problem based on four core models 1 a demand forecasting model at the station level 2 a station inventory model 3 a redistribution needs model and 4 a vehiclerouting model the novelty of this approach is that it is proactive instead of reactive as the bike redistribution occurs before inefciencies are observed increasing system performance and potentially customer satisfaction and uses the outputs of a machine learning technique to decompose the inventory and the routing problem the decomposition approach proposed 1 makes the problem scalable to large bikesharing systems 2 allows for real time implementation making routing decisions every time a vehicle completes a limited tour 3 is responsive to operator inputs and 4 can accommodate userspecic

in addition the underlying models based on historical data are selfadaptive as they are constantly being retrained using the most recent data available simulation results based on data associated with the hubway bikesharing system show that signicant improvements to the overall system performance could have been made over and above that being achieved under current operation using the proposed modeling approachachieving improvements of nearly 7 in the afternoon peak as expected performance measures are better when the predictive model makes better predictions more comprehensive tests using a full week of data demonstrate how the methodology could be used to evaluate such decisions as eet size and vehicle capacity to test the full potential of the framework tests using realtime data under closedloop control should be used ie data that are not already the outcomes of operational decisions and compared to the current rebalancing decisions made by the operator however access to such data was not possible having outlined the fundamental philosophy behind and demonstrated the applicability of the framework further research should focus on 1 ne tuning each model 2 incorporating a userbased relocation model 3 building it as a web application tool for bikesharing operators to use and 4 testing its transferability to other bikesharing systems in terms of improving the various models the forecasting model should incorporate more independent variables such as large events eg basketball games concerts etc transit arrivals and departures in areas nearby bikesharing stations or real time dis tribution of people in the city which could be gathered from cellphone towers or social media data for the routing model different objective functions can be proposed that incorporate the concept of maximizing a cumulative reward instead of the immediate benet gained by routing a vehicle to a station additionally some of the input parameters such as s could be made selfadaptive to

regression algorithm the univariate models were used to model the number of available bikes at each station plsr was applied to reduce the number of required prediction models and reflect the spatial correlation between stations in the network results clearly show that univariate models have lower error predictions than the multivariate model however the multivariate models results are reasonable for networks with a relatively large number of spatially correlated stations results also show that station neighbors and the prediction horizon time are significant predictors the most effective prediction horizon time that produced the least prediction error was 15 minutes keywordsbike prediction bikesharing systems urban computing i introduction a growing population with more people living in cities has led to increased pollution noise congestion and greenhouse gas emissions one possible approach to mitigating these problems is encouraging the use of bikesharing systems bsss bsss are an important part of urban mobility in many cities and are sustainable and environmentally friendly as urban density and its related problems increase it is likely that more bsss will exist in the future due to relatively low capital and operational costs ease of installation pedal assistance for people who are physically unable to pedal for long distances or on difficult terrain and better tracking of bikes 1 one of the first bsss in the united states was established in 1964 in portland with,"[101, 5718, 12740, 2620, 16576, 2595, 11387, 17134, 2581, 19841, 15136, 2575, 16806, 2615, 1056, 1056,

60 bicycles available for public use although bsss are still relatively limited at present many cities such as san francisco and new york have launched programs these programs implement different payment structures conditions and logistical strategies of primary interest to this paper are those that rely on information technology it one of the largest itbased systems based in montreal canada is bixi bicycletaxi which employs the concept of using a bicycle like a taxi bixi with its use of advanced technologies for implementation and management illustrates a shift into the fourth generation of bsss 2 in 2013 san francisco launched the bay area bike share bss a membershipbased system providing 24hoursperday 7daysperweek selfservice access to shortterm rental bicycles members can check out a bicycle from a network of automated stations ride to the station nearest their destination and leave the bicycle safely locked for someone else to use 3 the bay area bike share is designed for short quick trips and as a result additional fees apply for trips longer than 30 minutes in this system 70 bike stations connect users to transit businesses and other destinations in four areas downtown san francisco palo alto mountain view and downtown san jose 3 bay area bike share is available to everyone 18 years and older with a credit or debit card the system is designed to be used by commuters and tourists alike whether they are trying to get across town at rush hour traveling to and from bay area rapid transit bart and caltrain stations or pursuing daily activities 3 this paper proposes an approach to modeling the number of available bikes at a bike share station using machine learning since the number of available bikes at a station which has a finite number of docks fluctuates a repositioning or redistribution operation must be performed periodically coordinating such a large operation is complicated time consuming polluting and expensive 1 predicting the number of available bikes in each station over time is one of the key tasks to making this operation more efficient in this study random forest rf and leastsquares boosting lsboost algorithms were used to build univariate prediction models for available bikes at each bay area bike share station however to reduce the number of required prediction models for the entire bss network we also used partial leastsquares regression plsr as a multivariate regression algorithm following the introduction this paper is organized into five sections section ii briefly discusses related work from the literature focusing on the methods proposed in previous studies next a background of the regression models used is presented in section iii in section iv the different data sets used in this study are described the details of the data analysis used to construct predictive models of the number of available bikes are preprint provided in section v finally the paper concludes with a summary of new insights and recommendations for future research on modeling the number of available bikes ii related work the modeling of bike sharing data is an area of significant research interest proposed models,"[101, 3438,

four predictive models to predict the number of available bikes at each station last value historical mean historical trend and bayesian network 12 two methods for time series analysis autoregressive moving average arma and autoregressive integrated moving average arima have also been used to predict the number of available bikesdocks for each bike station kaltenbrunner meza grivolla codina and

hourly bicycle counts and weather data to model bicycle traffic in vancouver canada 15 that study used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average analysis to account for the complex serial correlation patterns in the error terms and tested the model against actual bicycle traffic counts the results demonstrated that the weather had a significant and important impact on bike usage the authors found that the weather data namely temperature rain humidity and clearness were generally significant temperature and rain specifically had an important effect a multivariate linear regression analysis was used by rixey to study stationlevel bss ridership 10 that study investigated the correlation between bss ridership and the following factors population density retail job density bike walk and transit commuters median income education presence of bikeways nonwhite population negative association days of precipitation negative association and proximity to a network of other bss stations the author found that demographics the built environment and access to a comprehensive network of stations were critical factors in supporting ridership this paper makes two major contributions to the literature first the univariate response models that have been used previously to predict the number of available bikes at each station ignore the correlation between stations and might become hard to implement when applied to relatively large networks thus this paper investigates the use of multivariate response models to predict the number of available bikes in the network second station neighbors which are determined by a trips adjacency matrix are considered as significant predictors in the regression models iii methods in this section we will briefly describe the three machine learning algorithms used in this paper rf lsboost and plsr a random forest rf breiman proposed rf as a new classification and regression technique in supervised learning 16 rf creates an ensemble of decision trees and randomly selects a subset of features to grow each tree while the tree is being grown the data are divided by employing a criterion in several steps or nodes the

of the responses is used for regression rf offers several advantages 16 17 for example there are very few assumptions attached to its theory it is considered to be robust against overfitting it runs efficiently and relatively quickly with a large amount of data and many input variables without the need to create extra dummy variables it can handle highly nonlinear variables and categorical interactions and it ranks each variables individual contributions in the model however rf also has a few limitations for instance the observations must be independent which is assumed in our case b leastsquares boosting lsboost lsboost is a gradient boosting of regression trees that produces highly robust and interpretable procedures for regression lsboost was proposed by friedman as a gradient based boosting strategy 18 using square loss 22 where is the actual training and is the current cumulative output 0 1 1 1 the new added training is set to minimize the loss in which the training error is computed as in 19 1 where is the current residual error and the combination coefficients are determined by solving 0 in this paper rf and lsboost were used as univariate regression techniques to model the number of available bikes in each station at any time rf and lsboost are ensemble learning algorithms which integrate multiple decision trees to produce robust models however the main difference between these two algorithms is the order in which each component tree is trained using randomness rf trains each tree independently whereas lsboost trains one tree at a time and each new added tree is set to correct errors made by previously trained trees the ensemble model is produced by synthesizing results from the individual trees c partial leastsquares regression plsr plsr was recently developed as a multivariate regression algorithm 2024 plsr finds a linear regression model by projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to a new space the basic model in the plsr method consists of a regression between two blocks ie and furthermore preprint this model contains outer relations for each of the and blocks and an inner relation that links both blocks plsr has several advantages for example it is suitable when the matrix of predictors has more variables than observations and when there is multicollinearity among observable variable values moreover the plsr method outperforms multiple linear regressions because implementing plsr develops stable predictors in this paper plsr was used as multivariate regression to reduce the number of required prediction models for the number of available bikes at any time for the entire bss network iv data set this study used anonymized bike trip data collected from august 2013 to august 2015 in the san francisco bay area as shown in fig 1 25 this study used two data sets the first data set includes station id number of bikes available number of docks available and time of recording the time data

from 20 trees to 180 trees with a 40tree step as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 the prediction errors of rf and lsboost increase as the prediction horizon increases the lowest prediction error for both algorithms occurred at a 15 minute prediction horizon moreover the prediction error of rf and lsboost decreases as the number of trees increases until it reaches a point where increasing the number of trees will not significantly improve the prediction accuracy fig 2 and fig 3 also show that a model consisting of 140 trees yields a relatively sufficient accuracy preprint fig 2 rf mae at different prediction horizons and number of trees comparing the two algorithms the models produced by rf generally have a smaller prediction error than those produced by lsboost lsboost is a gradientboosting

of required prediction models for bike stations in the bss network when a bss network has a relatively large number of stations tracking all the specified models for each bike station becomes complex and timeconsuming for that reason we examined the adjacency matrix of the bay area bss network and found that the network can be divided into five regions as shown in fig 4 in fact the bike stations that resulted from the adjacency matrix in each region were found to share the same zip code this means that the majority of bike trips occurred within the same region and very few trips went from one region to another fig 4 adjacency matrix of the bay area bike share network using plsr as a regression algorithm can build prediction models for multivariate response therefore plsr was applied to reduce the number of models to five each of which is specified for one region ie one zip code to reflect the spatial correlation between stations the input predictors vector is which consists of the available bikes at the station at time the available bikes at its neighbors at the same time the month of the year day of the week time of day and various selected weather conditions the responses vector is log where 1 2 3 4 5 which is the log of the number of available bikes at all stations in each of the studied regions at a prediction horizon time range 15120 minutes we found that the prediction errors for plsr were higher than the rf and lsboost prediction errors when 15 minutes as shown in fig 5 although the prediction errors resulting from plsr were higher than the previous

for future work in this paper we modeled the number of available bikes at san francisco bay area bike share stations using machine learning algorithms the investigation applied two approaches using univariate regression algorithms rf and lsboost and using a multivariate regression algorithm plsr the univariate models were used to model the available bikes at each station rf with an mae of 037 bikesstation outperformed lsboost with an mae of 058 bikesstation on the other hand the multivariate model plsr was applied to model available bikes at the spatially correlated stations of each region obtained from the trips adjacency matrix results clearly show that the univariate models produced lower error predictions compared to the multivariate model in which the mae was approximately 06 bikesstation however the multivariate models results might be acceptable and reasonable when modeling the number of available bikes in bss networks with a relatively large number of stations investigating bss networks in terms of determined regions gives new insights to policy makers the fact that stations in each region derived by the multivariate analysis share the same zip code implies that most of the trips were short distance which may be influenced by the overtime fees applied when trips are longer than 30 minutes the results also illustrate that station neighbors prediction horizon time and weather variables eg temperature and humidity were found to be significant in modeling the number of available bikes specifically when the prediction horizon time increases the prediction error increases with the most effective prediction horizon being 15 minutes determining prediction horizon is beneficial to policy makers and technicians to learn how to manage the bss more responsively and achieve better performance in prediction future work could model the number of available bikes by adding memory as a predictor to handle information related to the number of available

location and combine with their asneed customer returns bike to the place which they would prefer to return this paper is asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the capital bike share program in washington dc firstly the multiple linear regression model was established by the conventional method multiple linear regression equation was obtained by using spss software after comparing the data with the real value it is indicated that the multiple linear regression model is less accurate after analysis we find that the data includes the dummy variables such as the time and the season hence this paper proposes a random forest model and a gbm packet to improve the decision tree the results and the accuracy of multiple regression analysis are greatly improved when use of random forest model to predict the demand for bicycle rental keywordsbike sharing system multiple linear regression analysis random forest gbm i introduction with the rapid development of the global lowcarbon movement and the increasing in the number of private cars city planning to expand the number of vehicles is increasing rapidly traffic congestion and environmental pollution problems are becoming more and more serious the public bicycle rental system is as the new public transport system to flourish in the world the public bicycle can not only in the short distance travel play the flexible and efficient advantages but also can effectively extend the scope of public transport service real time to master the number of bicycle rental bicycles to guide the needs of the public is conducive to the formation and planning departments to develop rental policy at present the public bicycle rental system is mainly for the rental demand forecast and the scheduling of the lease point 1 from the research in this area is relatively small the main reasonn because of the complex needs of public bicycles the impact of public bicycle rental demand forecast has many factors it is hard to consider all them together now in terms of public bike rental system there are mainly southeast university such as lu qiang2 and li yanhong beijing jiaotong university 3 respectively from the bus and taxi od data on the residents of the travel rules of the study according to the highway toll station measured od matrix data which is based on time slice of the traffic flow for the estimation and prediction camus 4 is to obtain the travel law of people wuyao the professor of changan university is based on multinomial logit model to forecast the demand of urban public bicycle rental 5 however there are few studies on the impact of weather factors on the number of public bicycle rental until now in this paper we provide a forecast

based on multiple linear regression model to forecast rental demand a data introduction bike sharing system is a ways of renting bicycles and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city using these systems people are able to rent a bike from a one pick up location and combine with their asneed customer returns bike to the place which they would prefer to return currently there are over 500 bikesharing programs around the world the data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel departure location arrival location and time elapsed is explicitly recorded therefore the bike sharing system is functioned as a sensor network which can be used for studying mobility in a city you are provided hourly rental data spanning two years the data mainly includes the following factors date time hourly date timestamp season 1 spring 2 summer 3 fall 4 winter 9781509055074173100 2017 ieee icis 2017 may 2426 2017

francisco bay area bike share stations using machine learning algorithms random forest rf and leastsquares boosting lsboost were used as univariate regression algorithms and partial leastsquares regression plsr was applied as a multivariate regression algorithm the univariate models were used to model the number of available bikes at each station plsr was applied to reduce the number of required prediction models and reflect the spatial correlation between stations in the network results clearly show that univariate models have lower error predictions than the multivariate model however the multivariate models results are reasonable for networks with a relatively large number of spatially correlated stations results also show that station neighbors and the prediction horizon time are significant predictors the most effective prediction horizon time that produced the least prediction error was 15 minutes keywordsbike prediction bikesharing systems urban computing i introduction a growing population with more people living in cities has led to increased pollution noise congestion and greenhouse gas emissions one possible approach to mitigating these problems is encouraging the use of bikesharing systems bsss bsss are an important part of urban mobility in many cities and are sustainable and environmentally friendly as urban density and its related problems increase it is likely that more bsss will exist in the future due to relatively low capital and operational costs ease of installation pedal assistance for people who are physically unable to pedal for long distances or on difficult terrain and better tracking of bikes 1 one of the first bsss in the united states was established in 1964 in portland with 60 bicycles available for public use although bsss are still relatively limited at present many cities such as san francisco and new york have launched programs these programs implement different payment structures conditions and logistical strategies of primary interest to this paper are those that rely on information technology it one of the largest itbased systems based in montreal canada is bixi bicycletaxi which employs the concept of using a bicycle like a taxi bixi with its use of advanced technologies for implementation and management illustrates a shift into the fourth generation of bsss 2 in 2013 san francisco launched the bay area bike share bss a membershipbased system providing 24hoursperday 7daysperweek selfservice access to shortterm rental bicycles members can check out a bicycle from a network of automated stations ride to the station nearest their destination and leave the bicycle safely,"[101, 1015, 5187, 2475, 2260, 16770, 2860, 2860, 2860, 25746, 19968, 7159, 10790, 16932, 2629, 11039,

locked for someone else to use 3 the bay area bike share is designed for short quick trips and as a result additional fees apply for trips longer than 30 minutes in this system 70 bike stations connect users to transit businesses and other destinations in four areas downtown san francisco palo alto mountain view and downtown san jose 3 bay area bike share is available to everyone 18 years and older with a credit or debit card the system is designed to be used by commuters and tourists alike whether they are trying to get across town at rush hour traveling to and from bay area rapid transit bart and caltrain stations or pursuing daily activities 3 this paper proposes an approach to modeling the number of available bikes at a bike share station using machine learning since the number of available bikes at a station which has a finite number of docks fluctuates a repositioning or redistribution operation must be performed periodically coordinating such a large operation is complicated time consuming polluting and expensive 1 predicting the number of available bikes in each station over time is one of the key tasks to making this operation more efficient in this study random forest rf and leastsquares boosting lsboost algorithms were used to build univariate prediction models for available bikes at each bay area bike share station however to reduce the number of required prediction models for the entire bss network we also used partial leastsquares regression plsr as a multivariate regression algorithm following the introduction this paper is organized into five sections section ii briefly discusses related work from the literature focusing on the methods proposed in previous studies next a background of the regression models used is presented in section iii in section iv the different data sets used in this study are described the details of the data analysis used to construct predictive models of the number of available bikes are preprint provided in section v finally the paper concludes with a summary of new insights and recommendations for future research on modeling the number of available bikes ii related work the modeling of bike sharing data is an area of significant research interest proposed models have relied on various features including time weather the built environment and transportation infrastructure in general the main goals of these models have been to boost the redistribution operation 46 to gain new insights into and correlations between bike demand and other factors 710 and to support policy makers and managers

gallop tse and zhao used continuous and yearround hourly bicycle counts and weather data to model bicycle traffic in vancouver canada 15 that study used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average analysis to account for the complex serial correlation patterns in the error terms and tested the model against actual bicycle traffic counts the results demonstrated that the weather had a significant and important impact on bike usage the authors found that the weather data namely temperature rain humidity and clearness were generally significant temperature and rain specifically had an important effect a multivariate linear regression analysis was used by rixey to study stationlevel bss ridership 10 that study investigated the correlation between bss ridership and the following factors population density retail job density bike walk and transit commuters median income education presence of bikeways nonwhite population negative association days of precipitation negative association and proximity to a network of other bss stations the author found that demographics the built environment and access to a comprehensive network of stations were critical factors in supporting ridership this paper makes two major contributions to the literature first the univariate response models that have been used previously to predict the number of available bikes at each station ignore the correlation between stations and might become hard to implement when applied to relatively large networks thus this paper investigates the use of multivariate response models to predict the number of available bikes in the network second station neighbors which are determined by a trips adjacency matrix are considered as significant predictors in the regression models iii methods in this section we will briefly describe the three machine learning algorithms used in this paper rf lsboost and plsr a random forest rf breiman proposed rf as a new classification and regression technique in supervised learning 16 rf creates an ensemble of decision trees and randomly selects a subset of features to grow each tree while the tree is being grown the data are divided by employing a criterion in several steps or nodes the correlation between any two trees and the strength of each individual tree in the forest affect also known as the forest error rate in classifying each tree practically the mean squared error of the responses is used for regression rf offers several advantages 16 17 for example there are very few assumptions attached to its theory it is considered to be robust against overfitting it runs efficiently and relatively quickly with a large amount of data and many input variables without the need to create extra dummy variables it can handle highly nonlinear variables and categorical interactions and it ranks each variables individual contributions in the model however rf also has a few limitations for instance the observations must be independent which is assumed in our case b leastsquares boosting lsboost lsboost is a gradient boosting of regression trees that produces highly robust and interpretable procedures for regression lsboost was proposed by friedman as a gradient based boosting strategy 18 using square loss 22 where is the actual training and is the current cumulative,"[101, 25624, 2361, 24529, 2063,

by solving 0 in this paper rf and lsboost were used as univariate regression techniques to model the number of available bikes in each station at any time rf and lsboost are ensemble learning algorithms which integrate multiple decision trees to produce robust models however the main difference between these two algorithms is the order in which each component tree is trained using randomness rf trains each tree independently whereas lsboost trains one tree at a time and each new added tree is set to correct errors made by previously trained trees the ensemble model is produced by synthesizing results from the individual trees c partial leastsquares regression plsr plsr was recently developed as a multivariate regression algorithm 2024 plsr finds a linear regression model by projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to a new space the basic model in the plsr method consists of a regression between two blocks ie and furthermore preprint this model contains outer relations for each of the and blocks and an inner relation that links both blocks plsr has several advantages for example it is suitable when the matrix of predictors has more variables than observations and when there is multicollinearity among observable variable values moreover the plsr method outperforms multiple linear regressions because implementing plsr develops stable

incident was documented every minute for 70 stations in san francisco over 2 years this data set contains a large number of recorded incidents this data set was exposed to a changedetection process to determine times when a change in bike count occurred at each station from this data set as a result of preprocessing the station id number of bikes available month day of the week and time of day were extracted for use as features subsequently each stations zip code was assigned and input to the set fig 1 stations map the second data set contains different attributes the date in monthdayyear format

different prediction horizons and number of trees b multivariate models plsr was used as a multivariate regression to reduce the number of required prediction models for bike stations in the bss network when a bss network has a relatively large number of stations tracking all the specified models for each bike station becomes complex and timeconsuming for that reason we examined the adjacency matrix of the bay area bss network and found that the network can be divided into five regions as shown in fig 4 in fact the bike stations that resulted from the adjacency matrix in each region were found to share the same zip code this means that the majority of bike trips occurred within the same region and very few trips went from one region to another fig 4 adjacency matrix of the bay area

specified for one region ie one zip code to reflect the spatial correlation between stations the input predictors vector is which consists of the available bikes at the station at time the available

bss networks with a relatively large number of stations investigating bss networks in terms of determined regions gives new insights to policy makers the fact that stations in each region derived by the multivariate analysis share the same zip code implies that most of the trips were short distance which may be influenced by the overtime fees applied when trips are longer than 30 minutes the results also illustrate that station neighbors prediction horizon time and weather variables eg temperature and humidity were found to be significant in modeling the number of available bikes specifically when the prediction horizon time increases the prediction error increases with the most effective prediction horizon being 15 minutes determining prediction horizon is beneficial to policy makers and technicians to learn how to manage the bss more responsively and achieve better performance in prediction future work could model the number of available bikes by adding memory as a predictor to handle information related to the number of available bikes in the past acknowledgment this research effort was funded by the urbcomp program from the national science foundation

shenzhen university abstract as an important task for the management of bike sharing systems accurate forecast of travel demand could facilitate dispatch and relocation of bicycles to improve user satisfaction in recent years many deep learning algorithms have been introduced to improve bicycle usage forecast a typical practice is to integrate convolutional cnn and recurrent neural network rnn to capture spatialtemporal dependency in historical travel demand for typical cnn the convolution operation is conducted through a kernel that moves across a matrixformat city to extract features over spatially adjacent urban areas this practice assumes that areas close to each other could provide useful information that improves prediction accuracy however bicycle usage in neighboring areas might not always be similar given spatial variations in built environment characteristics and travel behavior that aect cycling activities yet areas that are far apart can be,"[101, 10250, 7875, 6072, 2063,

and recur rent neural network rnn are often integrated to capture the spatial and temporal information of trac demand 26 27 28 29 30 typically cnn exploits regular convolutional kernels scanning through the input features eg images to extract spatial characteristics of travel demand 31 rnn leverages the extracted temporal dynamic behavior from the past elements of the sequence to predict the

performance in various trac prediction tasks 17 21 22 23 however cnn has certain shortcomings when it is employed to capture spatialtemporal infor mation of bike sharing demand cnn achieves desirable performance in object detection for images because adjacent pixels of the same object are often highly correlated unlike images bicycle usage in neighboring urban areas can be quite dierent due to

similar temporal bicycle usage patterns two measures namely pearson correlation coecient irconvlstmp and dynamic time warping irconvlstmd are used as similarity metrics to identify semantic neighbors

methodology 41 overall architecture of the proposed model fig 2 illustrates the overall architecture of the proposed model the model consists of three separate modules with the same structure each module takes a specic set of historical observations bikesharing demand as input instead of using all the historical observations to train the model we identify key periods with dierent levels of recency to the target period for which the prediction is made and feed them into the three modules the approach eectively reduces the time complexity of the training model by also mitigating the negative eect of redundant information in historical data this practice has proved to achieve better performance than models trained using full historical observations 20 23 21 52 the denitions of the

the convolutional operation generally the number of cells involved in the convolution is known as the convolutional kernel size among cells corresponding to each kernel the cell being forecast is called the central cell and the other cells involved in convolution are called neighbors taking the convolutional kernel size of nine as an example the neighbors involved in traditional convolution are spatially adjacent to the central cell as shown in fig 3a in contrast the neighbors can be located anywhere in the study area for irregular convolution fig 3b in this study for each central cell

closeness as mentioned in 41 given a target period for which the prediction is made we identify three key periods from historical observations according to the levels of recency to the target period we name them as closeness period and trend fig 2 the purpose of selecting observations from these periods as inputs is to reduce the negative impact of redundant information in the whole training data on model performance while lowering the training time complexity for example the usage patterns of shared bicycles during peak hours may be similar during weekdays and bicycle usage might be associated with that at the same time in the previous week this strategy of identifying key periods as training input has proved to achieve better performance than models trained using full historical

also performs better than lstm although strn and cnnlstm achieve good prediction results the performance of our proposed model is still better than them in all indicators notably our proposed model achieves an improvement of mape from 8 in washington dc to 12 in london compared to the model with the best performance in four benchmarks compared to cnnlstm our proposed model only replaces the spatial neighbors involved in regular convolution with the semantic neighbors adopted in irregular convolution however the pre diction accuracy of our model is much higher than cnnlstm across ve cities specically among ve cities our approach achieves an improvement of mape by 815 compared to cnnlstm such results imply that the semantic neighbors are more eective than spatial neighbors for predict ing bikesharing usage the semantic neighbors are identied according to the similarity of temporal bicycle usage to their corresponding central cells although the semantic neighbors are not always spatially adjacent to their central cells they can provide essential information for spatialtemporal modeling than the spatial neighbors therefore the prediction results suggest that involving seman tic neighbors in the irregular convolution is a good strategy for predicting sharedbicycle usage across all study areas we also nd that the performance of the variant with dtw metric is better than the variant with pearson measure in most cities the variant with pearson correlation coecient only performs slightly better in two cities singapore and washington dc from the perspective of mape based on the characteristics of pearson correlation coecient the usage variations of two measured sequences are simply reected by their respective standard deviations and the temporal osets between such two sequences cannot be quantied by the coecient in contrast dtw metric is eective to measure the similarity of usage variations between two sequences by calculating the distance of each record in one sequence to all other observations in the other also the shortest warping distance between the sequences searched by dtw metric reects the similarity without the eects of temporal osets between the sequences in other words for two sequences that are not synchronized dtw metric is able to quantify their similarity more precisely than pearson correlation coecient especially for quantifying the similarity of temporal bicycle usage patterns dtw metric which considers the temporal osets better reects the similarity of travel behavior among areas in sum our proposed model achieves the best overall performance compared to other baseline models also dtw metric is an eective way to select semantic neighbors involved in the irregular convolution 52 performance of models over cells with varying levels of bicycle usage when operating bikesharing systems one of the important tasks is to satisfy users travel needs however bikesharing demand is not evenly distributed in urban areas the number of areas with high user demand is relatively small but most users intend to ride bicycles in such areas in contrast areas with low demand require fewer bicycles but they are widely distributed in the city therefore there is a tradeowhen allocating bicycles across urban areas if the travel demand in areas with dierent usage,"[101, 2036, 10438, 2488, 2084, 1048, 3367, 2213, 2348, 2358, 6826,

irregular convolution has a notable improvement in model performance compared to the benchmark cnnlstm in 13 corporating spatial neighbors in traditional convolution here we perform an additional analysis to gain insights into the spatial relationship between cells semantic and spatial neighbors first we analyze the dierence in temporal similarity between the central cell and spatial neigh bors vs the central cell and semantic neighbors as shown in fig 7 the similarity of temporal usage patterns between central cells and their semantic neighbors is generally higher than that between central cells and their spatial neighbors combined with the prediction accuracy of our model and cnnlstm the similarity of semantic neighbors is more eective in enhancing the accuracy of deep learning models however the traditional convolution fails to leverage such similarity due to its structural limitations moreover the similarity dierences between the two types of neighbors imply that directly applying traditional convolution involving spatial neighbors for shared bicycle usage prediction might not always achieve desirable performance in the ve study sites evaluated in this research cnnlstm

more than 70 of central cells have their spatial and semantic neighbors sharing less than two cells which can be observed under both pearson and dtw metrics this fact indicates that the semantic neighbors are mainly distributed at nonspatially adjacent ar eas to the central cells further illustrating the dierence between semantic and spatial neighbors in other words some areas in a city though far apart could show relatively similar temporal bicycle usage patterns than spatially adjacent areas this is potentially attributed to built environment characteristics urban functions and

system in singapore and four stationbased systems in chicago washington dc new york and london the irregular convolution is applied over semantic neighbors that refer to places with temporal usage patterns similar to those of the areas being forecast to measure the cells similarity and build the semantic neighbors one variant of our model uses the pearson correlation coecient while the other adopts dynamic time warping dtw our proposed model and four benchmark models are 14 pearson coefficient dtw a b no of overlap between semantic and spatial neighbors figure 8 number of overlapping cells between a centrals spatial and semantic neighbors a results based on pearson correlation coecient b results based on dynamic time warping dtw evaluated in ve cities based on the prediction results the proposed model generally outperforms the benchmarks across ve cities the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is also higher than that of the benchmarks in areas with dierent bicycle usage levels and during peak hours comparing the two variants of our model the performance of the variant with the dtw metric is better than that of the variant with the pearson coecient metric in most of the cities we nd that the semantic neighbors adopted in the irregular convolution are quite dierent from the spatial neighbors involved in the traditional convolution specically the similarity of temporal usage patterns between the central cells and their semantic neighbors is generally higher than that between the central cells and their spatial neighbors under both the pearson and dtw metrics unlike the spatial neighbors the semantic neighbors are mainly distributed in areas that are not spatially adjacent to their central cells the model comparison suggests that relating areas that share similar temporal usage patterns through irregular convolution is helpful to improving the prediction accuracy the ndings also indicate that the neighbors involved in the convolution and the metrics for quantifying similarity eg pearson correlation vs dtw among urban areas tend to inuence the performance of the prediction model the study suggests that thinking beyond spatial neighbors can inspire new solutions that improve shortterm travel demand prediction the implications go beyond applications of bike sharing systems in general a reliable travel demand or trac prediction model requires a good understanding on the spatialtemporal dependency of historical travel demand although the subjects being studied could vary eg vehicles cyclist pedestrians and goods it is reasonable to assume that there exists spatial autocorrelation in travel patterns this partially explains why deep learning architecture with typical cnn ie by capturing spatial dependency is helpful to improving travel demand prediction in dierent transportation applications however given that travel patterns are aected by spatial variations of built environment characteristics urban functions and socioeconomic characteristics areas close to each other might show dierent travel dynamics that are sometimes not correlated over time therefore the typical cnn architecture can sometimes introduce noise into the prediction process the irregular convolution with semantic neighbors is one example of many possible strategies to overcome this limitation in this study the semantic neighbors are identied solely based on the temporal similarity,"[101, 2291, 1999, 5264, 1998, 2176, 2276, 15058, 2094, 3001, 1999, 3190, 2899, 5887, 2047, 2259, 1998, 2414, 1996, 12052, 9530, 6767, 7630, 3508,

in historical bicycle usage patterns these areas with similar temporal travel patterns could signify potential similarities in built environment characteristics and other factors that shape cycling be haviors however these environmental and socioeconomic characteristics are not directly utilized in our proposed model a possible direction for future research is to consider both travel patterns and 15 environmental factors for dening similarities and identifying semantic neighbors combing these static eg built environment characteristics and dynamic features ie bicycle usage patterns may further improve the robustness of the prediction model appendix a the structure of long shortterm memory network we adopt the long shortterm memory lstm model to extract temporal information from the features

sys tem bss this is relevant in order to make recommenda tions guaranteeing that the probability that a user will be able to make a journey is suciently high to do this we use probabilistic predictions obtained from a queuing theo retical timeinhomogeneous model of a bss the model is parametrized and successfully validated using historical data from the v elib bss of the city of paris we develop a critique of the standard rootmeansquare error rmse commonly adopted in the bikesharing re search as an index of the prediction accuracy because it does not account for the stochasticity inherent in the real system instead we introduce a new metric based on scoring rules we evaluate the average score of our model against classical predictors used in the literature we show that these

over the use of a personal bicycle with respect to maintenance theft or storage issues a bss is composed of a number of stations where a lim ited number of bikes can be parked the dynamics is sim ple a user arrives at a station to pick up a bike the ride ends when she returns the bike to any station user experi ence and provider revenue can be hampered when the origin station is empty which forces the user to either resort to another means of transport or try to nd an available bike in another station similarly if the destination station is full the user must either wait until one bike is picked up or return the bike to another station with at least one parking spot available bss providers publish typically through their websites live data about the availability of bikes and empty park ing spots at bss stations as a means of helping users plan their journey this has caught the attention of many re searchers who used this data to study user behavior and mobility patterns 3 6 14 some notable eort has been put on the development of predictive models for bss which can be calibrated using the real available datasets 9 12 13 15 having a predictive model can benet both the user and the bss provider the user can employ it as a journey advisor 15 for instance identifying likely origindestination stations for which the trip can be successfully made bss providers can run the model to discover usage trends and proactively adopt countermeasures to potentially adverse situations such as performing a rebalancing to put more bikes in stations that will likely be emptied the rst contribution of this paper is a predictive model of availability in bss based on queuing theory we model a bss station as a queue which is subject to two stochastic events an arrival process for the bikes that are returned and a departure process for the bikes that are checked out by users wishing to start a journey thus each station is modeled in isolation but the eects from the overall bss are incorporated into these aggregate processes for instance the arrival process subsumes all journeys started from any bss station while the departure process accounts for pick ups by users who had not found an available bike elsewhere modeling a station in isolation simplies the analysis and the parameter tting this approximation is justied by the 703 oretical results stating that in the asymptotic regime of the number of stations going to innity under mild assumptions the stations can be viewed as independent of each other 7 8 furthermore this approximation is also used in more em pirical

validate that the real dynamics can be accu rately captured by timeinhomogenous poisson arrival and departure processes to the best of our knowledge such a validation of a theoretical model of bss has not been done before in contrast kaltenbrunner et al adopt a determin istic time series 13 while in 9 stochasticity is encoded as a hidden node in the bayesian network through a gaussian variable learned from the data our model also improves on two other aspects first being timeinhomogeneous it naturally accounts for nonstationary behavior a limitation of the autoregressive movingaverage model of 13 that was pointed out in 15 second it can predict the whole prob ability distribution of the number of bikes at a bss station instead of a coarser bayesian classication into occupation ranges as in 9 models that take into account the state of neighbouring stations have also been proposed a time series model is presented in 15 which encodes stochasticity through an exogenous normally distributed noise term to be tted from the data however the empirical results do not show signicant improvements over neighborhoodunaware predictive models guenther and bradley 12 consider both a timeinhomogeneous population continuoustime markov chain model and a model that uses regression analysis and errors tted to a time series the population model has the same probabilistic behaviour as the queuing model consid ered in this paper they use a uid approximation approach to obtain point estimators for bike availability in each sta tion of the system whereas we focus on the entire probability distribution for a single station furthermore we validate the core assumptions of the approach ie poisson arrivals the ability to make probabilistic forecasts can improve the usability of the models by both users and providers a group of users wishing to ride together may obtain an estimate for the probability of nding no fewer bikes than the group size at the origin station 15 bss providers on the other hand may rank critical stations according to the probabilities of them being empty or full at a given time unfortunately all the aforementioned approaches 9 13 15 12 only focus on point estimators acknowledging the stochastic nature of a bss also has an important implication on the methodology used to mea sure and compare the accuracy of its predictors in the bikesharing literature the most important accuracy index used so far has been the wellknown root mean square er ror rmse between the point predictor and the actual ob served outcome this is also the metric used

rmse of zero would indicate a perfect pre dictor larger values can be used to rank the accuracy of dierent predictors instead in this paper we show an anal ysis concluding that when applied to a bss even a point predictor with perfect information about the dynamical evo lution of the system cannot yield zero rmse second we observe that the point predictors available so far may not always be informative for practical applications such as the deployment of a recommendation system in this case for instance the user is not interested in the actual number of bikes available at some point in the future rather she is interested in being able to pick up a bike with high proba bility this information cannot be recovered directly from point estimators to overcome these diculties we propose new metrics for bss based on scoring rules known to be appropriate to evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic predictors and to rel atively compare them 11 we use classical scoring rules to evaluate our ability to predict the number of available bikes we propose a new scoring rule to evaluate our ability to rec ommend the feasibility of a journey based on a tuneable threshold on the probability of nding at least one bike at the origin station we apply this new methodology to eval uate the accuracy of our queuing model using a real dataset from v elib we show that for prediction horizons up to 5 hours it signicantly outperforms other predictors such as the lastvalue predictor where the prediction is equal to the last observed value and the historictrend predictor where the prediction equals the historical averages contributions to summarize this paper makes the fol lowing contributions we discuss an explanatory timeinhomogeneous queu ing theoretic model of a bss station and successfully validate it through tting of the arrival and departure processes to poisson distributions using real data from the v elib bss of the city of paris we show that rmse is not an appropriate metric for journey planning instead we propose new metrics based on scoring rules which can capture provider related measures eg estimating the number of bikes at a station as well as useroriented

horizons of 2 to 5 hours thus advocating its use as a probabilistic recommendation system for bss paper structure we discuss the queuing model in sec tion 2 and validate the model against historic

is not true in practice since when a station is empty no bike can depart from it therefore reduc ing the arrival rate at other stations an alternative more realistic assumption would be to consider a process for each trip from an origin i to a destination j with departure and arrival intensities ijt and ijt for each process how ever this greatly complicates the model and the parameter tting for little gain moreover the great number of sta tions usually involved in bss such as v elib allows us to apply the asymptotic analysis techniques introduced in 8 which argue that the isolation approximation becomes exact as the number of stations goes to innity therefore in this paper we restrict ourselves to a model in which each station behaves as an independent mm1queue under this

deterministic time series that represents the estimated number of bikes at a given station in the future in this section we show that regardless of their quality the rmse of such predictors will always be large due to the stochastic nature of bikesharing systems for instance we present evidence that the best rmse one can expect from a singlevalued estimator for a prediction 2 hours in advance

and 3 bikes at 1h for typical parameter values even if we have perfect knowledge of the parameters of our model see fig ure 6a note that these values are consistent with the ones found in 15 table i

we plot the rmse of the best predictor we consider two scenarios in which the capacity of the station is 20 bikes and such that at the time t 2 t when the predictions are made xt 10 bikes in the rst

for a pre diction at horizon h 5min and around 35 for a prediction at horizon h 1h this implies that even someone who has perfect knowledge of the parameters and of the system cannot predict the number of bikes in 1h with a rmse less than 35 bikes in particular this shows that the predictors presented in 15 all produce values that are close to the best that can be achieved the second remark is that the rmse is not sucient to provide the users with a precise indication on whether a trip is feasible in particular a user who wants to depart from a station is interested in knowing if there will be 0 or at least 1 bike but has little interest in the real value these numbers are hard to guess from deterministic predic tors for example in the unbalanced scenario the predic tions at 1h are

signicantly as the horizon grows reaching values worse by up to 50 for a large prediction horizon in fact we will see in section 5 that when one wants to assess the feasibility of a trip lastvalue is beaten by historic as soon as the prediction horizon exceeds h 1 hour this again reects the fact that the rmse is not an appropriate metric when the objective is to,"[101, 2057, 5436, 1996, 29311,

determine whether a trip will be successful lvp has a much smaller rmse than hp for a time horizon of 2h but is worse at predicting successful trips figure 9 because in the latter case knowing if there will be exactly 10 or 15 bikes in a station is less important whereas knowing if there will be 0 or 1 is critical as we will see in the next section we need a dierent metric to easily express these estimations and measure probabilistic forecasts 5 probabilistic forecasts and scoring rules bikesharing systems exhibit stochastic behavior hence an alternative to using a deterministic predictor is to forecast the probability distribution of the number of available bikes at the station in the future in this section we rst show how to evaluate probabilistic predictors by using proper scoring rules we then develop two scoring rules to assess the per formance of qmp in terms of its probabilistic predictions 51 proper scoring rules a probabilistic forecast for a value x can be represented by a probability distribution p a probabilistic forecast contains information about the value that we think x will take but also a measure of condence in this forecast a natural way to evaluate a forecast is to use proper scoring rules we now recall briey the mathematical denition of a proper scoring rule see 11 for a more complete exposition assume that we want to forecast a random variable x that takes values in a set x a scoring rule is a function sp x r that associates to each i 2 x a score sp i 2 r 1 the score of a forecast p is dened by its average score e sp x a scoring rule is said to be proper if when x is generated according to a probability distribution q the score is maximized by the distribution q in other word we have for any distribution p on x e sq x e sp x 5 it is strictly proper if q is the only maximizer of 5 note that scoring rules are dened without a priori knowledge on the distribution q it is not necessary to know q to dene a proper scoring rule and to compute the score sp x this is important as in practice the distribution q is unknown it is the one we try to forecast a proper scoring rule encourages honesty a forecaster knowing the true distribution q of x should issue a forecast p q if one is very condent that x x then the issued predictor p will be concentrated on a single value x in that case the score sp x will be high when x x but very low when x is far from x on the other hand when one has a low condence in the prediction p will give weight to many values and sp x will be neither high nor low regardless of the actual value of x skill score when evaluated over a trace of measurement the performance of a probabilistic forecast is measured,"[101, 5646, 3251, 1037, 4440, 2097, 2022, 3144, 1048, 2615, 2361, 2038, 1037, 2172,

described in section 23 provide a deter ministic or probabilistic estimation of the number of bikes in a station in the future each predictor is a probability distri bution over a nite set 0 1 i where i is the capacity of the station i considered note that a deterministic predic tor is a degenerated probabilistic predictor that assigns all the probability mass to a single value we evaluate numeri cally these predictors on the paris dataset by using classical scoring rules the results are reported in figure 7 the most classical scoring rules are brier score the spher ical score and the logarithmic score given a forecast p and a realization i brier score assigns a score sp i 2pi p j p2 j1 the spherical score assigns sp i pip j p2 j12 and the logarithmic score assigns sp i log pi to p respectively in figure 7 we report the average score of the three predictors dened in section 23 as a function of the prediction horizon for brier and the spherical score we choose not to report the performance of the logarithmic score for two reasons first because the performance of the qmp 709 a brier score b spherical score figure 7 average brier score and spherical score when predicting the number of bikes available the higher the score the better is the predictor and of hp exhibit the same trend and second because the average score of lvp is always 1 with this score lvp is a deterministic predictor so when the actual number of bikes is not exactly equal to the prediction the score is 1 for both scoring rules the shape of the curves are sim ilar the qmp has the best score for a prediction up to h 5 hours in advance after 5 hours hp becomes slightly better this seems to indicate that knowing the current number of bikes in a station is only important for prediction up to 2 to 3 hours in advance moreover for both scoring rules lvp quickly has the worst score for prediction hori zons larger than 10min brier or 45min spherical this comes from the deterministic nature of lvp leading to an overcondence in wrong predictions that tend to be heavily penalized by these scoring rules 53 scoring for the availability of one bike predicting the number of available bikes is important from the system operators point of view for example when she decides how to redistribute bikes in the system however this metric is less useful from a users point of view a user who wants to take a bike from a station is only interested in knowing if there is at least 1 bike available but is less interested in knowing eg if there are 5 or 15 bikes in this section we design a

0 corresponds to the always go behavior whereas a policy p 1 will always lead to a no go decision we are now interested in how often the dierent predictors are misleading from the users perspective depending on her threshold policy a probability of no go ok b probability of go figure 10 false positive and false negative probabil ities as functions of the threshold probability pfor a prediction horizon of h 30min lower is better in figure 10 we plot the proportion of bad decisions wrong go decisions or wrong no go decisions for a prediction horizon of 30 minutes as a function of the parameter p when this threshold is set to 0 the proportion of wrong go decisions is 11 this proportion corresponds to the proportion of wrong decisions of an always go policy it is consistent with the value 89 of figure 9a for both hp and qmp the proportion of wrong go decisions decreases as the threshold pincreases while the proportion of wrong no godecisions increases this is due to the fact that as p 711 increases the user less often decides to go to the station and therefore misses more opportunities the situation is dier ent for lvp in this case for any threshold p2 0 1 the decisions taken by a user using lvp are policyindependent since lvp returns a deterministic value lvp returns either the trip is feasible with probability 1 or the trip is feasible with probability 0 this shows an advantage of informing the user of the probability of the trip feasibility rather than just a recommendation to gonot go a user can set her own risklevel and decide to go as a function of this level 6 conclusions we presented an approach to make forecasts of availability in bike sharing systems bss our approach uses a queuing theoretic model unlike previous techniques based on time series analysis our model is explanatory in the sense that it provides an explicit timeinhomogeneous dynamics which is successfully validated across an entire oneyear dataset of all stations activity in v elib the bss of the city of paris the model naturally allows one to make probabilistic fore casts ie predictions of the probability distribution of the state of a station whereas previous work has focused on point estimators only shifting to this setting requires us to revisit the notion of accuracy of a predictor which until now was measured by the root mean square error between the estimate and the actual observation in this paper we challenged this view and proposed instead new scoring rules for bss predictors we believe that the possibility of making probabilistic forecasts has signicant added value since it may broaden the scope of the applicability of predictive models for in stance it more directly provides usercentric quantities of interest useful for journey planning such as the probability of nding a bike at the origin station and dually of nd ing an empty slot at the destination station furthermore it can be used in more sophisticated recommendation sys tems that

stations not only on their expected number of available bikes but also on higherorder moments eg the standard deviation to favour those that exhibit less variability the extensive model validation conducted in this paper suggests that our model can in general be used in these ap plications with high accuracy for prediction horizons up to 23 hours for longer time horizons we see on average no sig nicant gain of a model that takes into account the current number of bikes parked at a station compared to just using the historical trend in future work we plan to examine the prediction accuracy in specic critical circumstances for instance during peak times in popular stations that tend to be either completely empty or full a limitation of our model is the implicit assumption of independence which allowed us to consider a station as an isolated queuing system future work will aim to relax this by incorporating the bss network structure in order to im prove the prediction accuracy furthermore we will test the generality of the approach by validating the model against other public datasets of availability in bss 7 acknowledgments this work is supported by the eu project

for citizens comm utes as the rentsreturns of bikes at different stations in different periods are unbalanced the bikes in a system need to be rebalanced frequently realtime monitoring cannot tackle this problem well as it takes too much time to reallocate the bikes after an imbalance has occurred in this paper we propose a hierarchical prediction model to predict the number of bikes that will be rent fromreturned to each station cluster in a future period so that reallocation can be executed in advance we first propose a bipartite clustering algori thm to cluster bike stations into groups formulating a twolevel hierarchy of stations the total number of bikes that will be rent in a city is predicted by a gradient boosting regression tree gbrt then a multisimilaritybased inference model is proposed to predi ct the rent proportion across clusters and the intercluster transition based on which the number of bikes rent from returned to each cluster can be easily inferred we evaluate our model on two bike sharing systems in new york city nyc and washington dc dc respectively confirming our models advantage beyond baseline approaches 003 reduction of error rate especially for anomalous

traffic prediction 1 introduction bikesharing systems are widely deployed in many major cities like new york paris and beijing providing a convenient transpor tation mode for peoples commutes a user can rent ie check out a bike at a station near their origin and return ie check in it to a station close to their destination users are required to swipe an rfid card when checking outin a bike a record consisting of the bike id timestamp and station id is generated for each card swipe bikesharing systems face challenges in bike rebalance between stations intrinsically bike usage is skewed changing over time and locations consequently some stations may be jammed without enough docks for future returned bikes while some lack available bikes for interested users monitoring the current number of bikes at each station cannot tackle the challenge thoroughly,"[101, 2410, 1037, 10556, 29005, 19892, 4609, 3678, 1054, 2033, 4143, 1046, 24665, 20984, 4571, 1046, 19429, 3981, 1998, 1054,

as it is too late to reallocate bikes after an imbalance has occurred to address this issue we can predict the number of bikes that will be checked out from ie checkout and checked in to ie check in each station in a bikesharing system during a future period based on historical checkoutin data as well as meteorology data the predictions can help to operate a bikesharing system more efficiently improving resource utilization to achieve this goal is very challenging as bike traffic is impacted by multiple complex factors such as time of day day of week meteorology events and the correlation between stations 1 meteorology more people may check outin a bike on a sunny day than on a rainy day this phenomenon also exists between a cool day and a warm day same with days of different levels of wind however some categories of weather eg rainy occur rar ely while other categories like sunny may be very common in addition some temperature wind speed scenarios have never happened historically but may happen in the future eg117 c 46 mph for nyc these lead to an unbalanced distribution of data if partitioned by meteorology traditional machine learning models are trained to fit the majority of observations thus would scarify the models accuracy under minor conditions however being able to predict traffic under rare conditions eg rainy hours is as important as that under ordinary ones eg sunny hours 2 the correlation between stations first the bike traffic of nearby stations affect each other for instance when a station is full of bikes users have to check in their bikes at nearby stations likewise when a station is running out of bikes people turn to nearby stations for checking out second when the checkout in a origin region increases tremendously for some reason eg an unusual event checkin at other destination regions will be affected significantly beyond common patterns as a result the bike traffic at an individual station may change irregularly and the bike transition between stations may vary tremendously to tackle these challenges we propose a hierarchical prediction model which is comprised of five major components 1 a bipartite station clustering algorithm to cluster individual stations accord ing to their geographical locations and historical transition patterns explained in 312 2 an entire traffic prediction model to predict the total checkout of the whole city based on time and meteorology features 3 a checkout proportion prediction model to predict the checkout proportion of total checkout across station clusters 4 an intercluster transition prediction model to predict the dynamic bike transition probability between station clusters 5 a check outin inference algorithm to calculate the checkoutin of each station cluster based on the outputs of the former components our contributions are threefold the bipartite station clustering algorithm formulates a two level hierarchy of stations where the root consists of all the stations in a city improving the prediction accuracy for three reasons first the total checkout in a city ie the higher level permission to make digital or hard copies of all,"[101, 2004,

checkout across clusters in the lower level second the total traffic in a cluster is more regular and easier to predict than that at an individual station third the intercluster transition is more concentrated thus more robust than that between stations our clustering method considers stations geographical locations and transition patterns in an iterative approach resulting in much better clusters than other clustering methods we propose a multisimilaritybased inference model to pre dict the checkout proportion across clusters and the inter cluster transition the model integrates multiple similarities between the features of the period to be predicted and those of historical periods different features have different similarity functions which are learned collectively from

in our work 22 framework fig1 shows the framework of our model which consists of two processes offline process and online process fig 1 framework of our model offline process as shown with green rectangles in fig1 the offline process consists of the following five parts 1 bipartite station clustering to address the irregular fluctuation issue at each individual station we propose a bipartite clustering algorithm to cluster stations into groups in bipartite station cluste ring stations are clustered based on their geographical locations and historical transition patterns as a result stations in one cluster should not only be closed to each other geographically but also have similar transition patterns to clusters the result of clustering is the foundation of the following steps as all models are learned based on clusters except for the entire traffic model 2 entire traffic learning we leverage gbrt to learn an entire traffic model which is the root of our hierarchical prediction the features considered in gbrt which affect the entire traffic signifi cantly are extracted according to historical checkoutin data and meteorology data 3 checkout proportion learning to allocate the entire traffic to each cluster we need to predict the checkout proportion across clusters checkout proportion is predicted by a multisimilarity based inference model the most recent proportions 1 2 to the future period whose proportion we want to predict are selected out for 1 2 and their corresponding time and meteorology features 1 2 and are extracted to calculate the similarities 1 2 here is a similarity function these similarities are the weights we use to calculate the weighted average of 1 2 which is considered as the predicted checkout proportion in period the similarity function is learnt in this step 4 intercluster transition learning after a bike is checked out predicting its transition is necessary for checkin prediction an intercluster transition matrix defined in 34 is used to describe where a bike will be checked in given where and when it is checked out it is predicted using the same model with the previous step a multisimilaritybased inference model 5 trip duration learning the trip duration is another important element in bike transition the trip duration between each pair of clusters is described by a lognormal distribution whose parameters are calculated by maximum likelihood estimation these two trans ition elements intercluster transition and trip duration will be used in the checkin inference step later to help us estimate the probability that a bike will be checked in to a special cluster during a special period given when and where it is checked out online process as shown with yellow rectangles in fig 1 the online process consists of four steps entire traffic prediction checkout proportion prediction intercluster transition prediction and checkoutin inference we extract the time and meteorology locations

according to their geo graphical locations and transition patterns fig 2 a presents an example of the station clustering result in nyc where points with the same color denote stations pertaining to a same cluster the reasons that we group stations into clusters are twofold fig 2 bike data from 1st jun to 10th jul 2014 in nyc 1 affected by multiple complex factors such as meteorology and correlation between stations a single stations traffic seems too chaotic to predict fig 2 b and c respectively show checkout during 900am1000am of two nearby stations 1 and 2 from a same cluster which change from day to day very differently in addition it seems impossible to find any periodicity and regularity from an individual stations checkout particularly at a station whose checkout is sparse eg 2 the fluctuations over its mean observation seem random clustering stations has three benefits first after grouping some individual stations into a cluster 1 as presented in fig 2 d of its checkout during 900am1000am the periodicity and regularity become much obvious than those of a single station thus easier to predict second the clusters formulate a twolevel hierarchy of stations shown in fig 2 f based on which we can conduce hierarchical prediction fig 2 e shows the entire traffic during 900am1000am we can see that its periodi city and regularity are even more obvious and robust which makes the entire traffic prediction easier and more accurate thus the hierarchical prediction can improve the accuracy as an accurate prediction in the higher level entire traffic can bind the prediction error in the lower level checkout across clusters third the check out proportion across clusters and the intercluster transition are more concentrated thus robust than those of stations this is confirmed by fig 2 g which shows the average deviation of checkout proportion of cluster 1 cluster 2 station 1 and station 2 all in each hour of the day the figure about transition is similar and we do not show here for space reason 2 in reality predicting the checkoutin of each individual station is not necessary understanding each clusters checkoutin is enough for bike reallocation because users usually check outin bikes at a random station closed to their originsdestinations if a station is without available bikesdocks it is convenient for a user to check outin a bike at another nearby station in addition if some events happen which may affect bike usage they usually,"[101, 10817, 4083, 6970, 20464, 19966, 2121, 6653, 4083, 4638, 5833, 10817, 2944, 6970,

influence an area instead of only an individual station we consider the geographical location and transition pattern of a station simultaneously in an iterative approach for two reasons 1 considering that our aim is to offer more convenience to users stations in one cluster should be close to each other geographically thus it is practical for a user whose origin destination is close to a station without available bikesdocks to walkride to another station in the same cluster to check outin a bike 2 in addition as transition between clusters needs to be predicted later we would like the intercluster transition to be robust in order to improve prediction accuracy therefore the stations in one cluster should have similar transition patterns to all the clusters consequently the transition vector of a cluster which is a multinomial distribution would concentrate on several values instead of being more even distributed for example comparing two multinomial distributions 01 01 01 and 06 040 0 it is obvious that the first one is more even distributed but less robust than the second one 312 methodology fig 3 a presents the iterative procedure of the bipartite station clustering algorithm which organically combines two factors location and transition of stations without needing to assign a weight for each factor which requires for prior knowledge circles with the same color denote bike stations that belong to the same cluster the algorithm repeats the following three steps in each ite ration geoclustering tmatrix generation and tclustering fig 3 bipartite clustering algorithm procedure 1 geoclustering this step clusters stations into 1 groups 1 1 1 according to stations geographical locations by k mean clustering for the first time geoclustering is conducted on all stations in a sharing system for the following times geo clustering is conducted on the stations in each cluster obtained in step 3 proportionally for example if the number of stations in each cluster obtained in step 3 is 1 2 2 then we cluster the stations in each cluster into 11 21 21 groups respectively here is a rounding operator 2 tmatrix generation based on clusters obtained in step 1 we generate a tmatrix for each station a tmatrix describes a stations transition pattern it has seven rows corresponding to seven time slots 700am1100am morning rush hours

prediction the variables are features correspond ing to period which have significant influence on the entire traffic is the ground truth ie the actual entire traffic in period thus we need to identify the important features first time features the entire traffic is affected by time we identify two time features the time of day and the day of week fig 4 shows the average entire traffic in aug 2014 in different hours and on different days as we can see the entire traffic on weekdays are similar consisting of morning rush hours day hours evening rush hours and night hours while those on weekendsholidays are similar consisting of night hours trip hours and evening hours the entire traffic on weekdays is much larger than that on weekendsholidays and that in rush hourstrip hours is much larger than those in other time slots therefore the time of day and the day of week are important features in entire traffic prediction fig 4 average entire traffic in nyc meteorology features bike is a kind of transportation which is affected by meteorology significantly three major meteorology features are identified weather temperature and wind speed fig 5 a shows the average entire traffic in

all correspond to 13th aug which was rainy a large number of this kind of exceptive examples in historical data support the conclusion that weather influences the entire traffic significantly based on historical data we categorize all weather patterns into four categories snowy rainy foggy and sunny fig 5 b shows the total traffic every day from feb to aug 2014 in nyc as we can see there is an increasing trend this is because that the temper ature keeps increasing from feb to aug fig 5 c describes the entire traffic in dc during 800am900am in sep 2014 the anomalous point in the red circle corresponds to 25th sep which is a windy day lots of similar anomalous points related to wind speed can be found on other days as well in summary three meteorology features weather temperature and wind speed are identified to affect the entire traffic significantly fig 5 average entire traffic after identifying the time and meteorology features influencing the entire traffic we can obtain a

other as well this constraint incorporates the interaction between clusters into the model if we predict the checkout of each cluster individually the influence between clusters will be ignored our multisimilaritybased inference model integrates three simi larity functions between features of the period to be predicted and those of historical ones 1 time similarity 11 2 intuitively the checkout proportion across clusters changes from time to time first the proportion changes from hour to hour in a day for example to the clusters which mainly consist of stations near residential areas their check out proportions in morning rush hours would be much larger than those in evening rush hours second the proportion changes from day to day in a week for example for the clusters which mainly consist of stations close to tourist areas their checkout proportions in trip hours on weekendsholidays would be much larger than those on weekdays 2 weather similarity 21 2 as proportion across clusters is a vector instead of a single value we illustrate how to visualize it first euclidean distance is adopted to measure the difference of two proportion vectors ie proportion distance analyzing nycs and dcs historical bike data we extract a proportion distance pattern over one week shown in fig 7 c stations are clustered as fig 2 a each node describes the distance between two

we can see the distances between vectors on two successive weekdays eg mon and tue denoted by green circles are small and similar while those between vectors on a weekday and a weekendholiday eg fri and sat denoted by red circles are much larger unexpe ctedly the distance between vectors on sat and sun denoted by a yellow circle is not as small as those between two weekdays we think this is because people usually treat the first and the last day of a holiday differently however as it is much smaller compared with those between a weekday and a weekendholiday we do not differentiate them the pattern is used to detect anomalies fig 7 a shows the distance of two checkout proportion vectors during 700am800am on two successive days in aug from the bikesharing system in nyc eg the point 5 00298 means the distance between the checkout proportion vectors during 700am 800am on 5th aug and on 6th aug is 00298 compared with fig 7 c points in solid circles are anomalous while those in dash circles match the pattern well the two points in the solid circle correspond to two pairs of successive days 12th aug and 13th aug 13th aug and 14th aug among these three time periods 700am 800am on 13th aug is a rainy hour while the other two are sunny hours different weather patterns lead to larger difference between checkout proportion vectors lots of this kind of points can be fou nd which

across clusters significantly in a similar way temperature is identified as another important feature and we do not show here for space reason we consider the three factors of meteorology weather temperature and wind speed with two different similarity functions instead of one for two reasons first the values of weather are discrete while those of temperature wind speed are continuous whose discreti zation needs prior knowledge second to temperature wind speed there are missing scenarios which do not exist to weather 332 methodology assume that 1 2 are the most recent periods to whose checkout proportion across clusters we want to predict denote their corresponding checkout proportions as 1 2 and features as 1 2 and therefore can be predicted by a multisimilaritybased inference

corresponding to different hours given that the other features are similar in addi tion if two proportion vectors both belong to weekdays or week endsholidays and correspond to similar other features the more closed the two days are the more similar these two vectors should be for example the checkout proportion across clusters in 800am900am yesterday is more similar with that in 800am a weather

2 temperature wind speed similarity temperaturewind speed domain is continuous their historical data have missing scena rios therefore we choose a 2d gaussian kernel function 16 to measure the similarity between 1 1 and 2 2 so that the similarity between missing scenarios can be estimated as well the 2d gaussian kernel function is as eq 11 1 1 2 2 1 212 122 1 2 122 2 2 11 as the prediction errors of successive time periods are not indepen dent we add an error autoregression item to the multisimilarity based inference model thus the multisimilaritybased model we adopt practically is as eq 12 1 1 1 12 here the added items are the prediction errors of periods 12 is a threshold of time lag 34 intercluster transition learning in order to guarantee the causality between checkout and checkin we predict each clusters checkin based on their checkout inter cluster transition is an important factor in measuring the perform ances of checked out bikes definition 5 transition probability the transition probability from cluster to in time is the probability that a bike will be checked in to cluster given that it is checked out from in time note that only the checkout time is constrained to while the checkin time can be a random possible value definition 6 intercluster transition matrix an intercluster tran sition matrix in is a matrix corresponding to period each of whose entry is a transition probability from cluster to cluster in time intercluster transition matrix describes the transition probability between clusters similar to the checkout proportion across clus ters the intercluster transition matrix is affected by the correlations between clusters the time and the meteorology as well thus we adopt the same model multisimilaritybased inference model to predict the intercluster transition matrix 35 trip duration learning trip duration between each pair of clusters is another important factor in measuring the behavior of a checked out bike the trip duration distribution between a pair of clusters is mainly determ ined by the locations of stations in them which are spatially instead of temporally determined in bike traffic jam is no longer an impor tant factor that affects trip duration thus under most meteorology scenarios except for the really severe ones trip duration does not change too much we assume that the trip duration distribution between each pair of clusters is constant the severe meteorology scenarios are ignored because we have discovered that the severe ones mainly affect the bike traffic demand instead of the trip dura tion according to historical bike data we think this is because if a customer chooses to ride a bike on a snowy day for example this means that the snow may not be a big obstacle on their way to the destination otherwise they may prefer another kind of transp ortation which results in a decrease in bike traffic demand fig 9 trip duration distribution according to nycs bike data in 2014

leverage the three models trained above to obtain the entire traffic prediction checkout proportion prediction and intercluster transition matrix prediction respectively then the checkout of each

total checkin of a city predict the checkin proportion across clusters and calculate each clusters checkin in this section we introduce another algorithm to infer the checkin of each cluster based on checkout intercluster transition matrix and trip duration the insight is that this can guarantee the causality between check out and checkin thus if an anomaly happens its influence to checkin can be predicted at the same time when it influences the checkout instead of after a time delay as checkin is always after checkout we will show the effectiveness of this inference algorithm under anomalous scenarios with experiments later in application these two methods for checkin prediction can be used complementarily the first one for common scenarios and the second one for anomalous scenarios the details of the second inference algorithm are illustrated as follow we divide the checkin into two parts assume that the current time period is denote its corresponding time interval as then the checkin to cluster in are the bikes which have been checked out before and will be checked in to in and the bikes that will be checked out in and be checked in to in denote the bikes that have been checked out before but have not been returned as 1 2 1 to each of them its original cluster is and its checkout time is time slot is based on the intercluster transition matrix and trip duration its probability to be checked in to cluster in is as eq 14 14 therefore the expectation of the number of bikes in 1 2 1 that will be checked in to cluster in can be calculated as eq 15 1 15 for bikes that will be checked out in we predict their check in to cluster in in a similar way assuming that each clusters checkout in is 1 2 we divide which is set as 1 hour in our work into 60 time slots 60 60 30

arma we differentiate the time of day and the day of week as well gbrt similar with entire traffic prediction each clusters check outin can be predicted by gbrt individually and directly hpknn hierarchical prediction method based on knn is used we predict the entire traffic of the city first and then allocate the entire traffic to each cluster based on the checkout proportion acro ss clusters which is predicted by knn prediction 3 gc uniform geographical grid clustering this means we divide the city into uniform grids the stations which fall into the same grid form a cluster gc is commonly used in many works in our work we use gc instead of kmean clustering because the stations in a city especially those in nyc are distributed almost evenly instead of into communities however

conditions 1 the entire traffic in this period is much different from the pattern 2 the checkoutin proportion across clusters in this period is much different from the pattern for example fig 10 shows the entire traffic in every hour from 11th sep to 17th sep in nyc points in red rectangles are anomalous periods whose entire traffics deviate from the pattern significantly the ones satisfying the second condition can be detected in a similar way as the number of anomalous periods in our testing data are small and their deviations are obvious we can detect them manually however for massive detection a formal definition is required we can define much different as the data deviate with c from the mean here c is a parameter is the standard deviation of historical data in our experiments we

there is only 1 cluster its checkout is the entire traffic which can be predicted with a high accuracy when there are clusters which means that each station forms a cluster the checkoutin of a cluster fluctuates tremendously and an accurate prediction is difficult if not impossible however on the other side the number of clusters cannot be too small because if the clusters are too large eg 1 cluster containing all the stations reallocating bikes to clusters cannot offer convenience to users therefore the number of clust ers should be chosen by knowledge and experience in our experiments we cluster all the stations in the two bike sharing systems in nyc and dc into 23 and 27 clusters respect ively by two clustering methods gc and bc as shown in fig 11 the stations in one cluster are close to each other however the results of bc are much different from those of gc because of the additional transition pattern constraint results of checkout based on each clustering result we compare the checkout prediction results of different methods ha arma gbrt hpknn and hpmsi we concentrate on the results of nyc data as those of dc data are similar table 3 shows the average rmlse and er of all the predicted hours common and anomalous hours and the anomalous hours respectively in table 3 as we can see when adopting hpknn and hpmsi the results obtained under bc are better than those under gc because both of them are hierarchical prediction methods and bc can improve the accuracy of checkout proportion prediction we propose bc to guarantee the intercluster transition matrix to be more robust although to ensure more robust checkout proportion is not considered explicitly in the procedure of bc it is a byproduct this is because by bc the stations clustered into one group perform similarly in transition similar transition patterns of stations usually mean similar points of interest pois around them stations having similar pois are more likely to have similar check outin performances thus in a special period of a day the check out proportion vector would concentrate on several values instead of being more evenly distributed when adopting ha arma and gbrt bc is not always better than gc this is because each clusters checkout is predicted individually proportion across clusters which can be predicted more accurately by bc is not required for anomalous hours the rmlse and er of ha and arma are very large because neither of these two models have taken any external features into account but on the contrary the performa nces of gbrt hpknn and hpmsi are much better as they have considered temporal features when predicting note that although hpknn performs better than gbrt when comparing their results for all the predicted hours its accuracy for anomalous hours is lower than that of gbrt this is because hpknn is a hierarchical prediction method which can improve the prediction accuracy however as it only takes temporal features into consideration for higher level prediction but not for lower level prediction its performance,"[101, 2045, 2003, 2069, 1015, 9324, 2049, 4638, 5833, 2003, 1996, 2972, 4026, 2029, 2064, 2022, 10173, 2007, 1037, 2152,

checked out before t checked out in t checked out before t checked out in t common hours anomalous hours intercluster transition error trip duration error checkout prediction error intercluster transition error trip duration error distribution of bikes is the routes between each pair of stations etc because of the complexity of computation lower bound methods were proposed to extend the models to large databases currently reallocation is executed after monitoring which is not efficient prediction works can help to detect the potential unbalances in advance however previous prediction methods cannot be adopted to our work directly as our problem is to predict the checkoutin of each station cluster instead of the entire traffic in addition data formats are different eg our dataset does not contain information about the number of available bikesdocks at each station while those in 121322 do as bike traffic is impacted by multiple complex factors a more flexible model is required to guarantee a higher accuracy 62 traffic prediction in urban computing a series of traffic prediction research using datadriven methods has been done in urban computing 25 which aims to use big data to tackle urban challenges for instance shang et al 17 inferred the travel speed and traffic volume on each road segment based on gps trajectories of a sample of vehicles as well as map data and weather conditions wang et al 21 proposed a model to predict timedependent travel time of a path based on taxi trajectories pois and road networks yuan et al 2324 presented a cloudbased system that computes the quickest driving routes based on traffic conditions and driver behaviors they even predicted the travel time between two landmark locations pan et al 15 proposed methods to detect traffic anomalies based on gps trajectories and social media our resea rch is also a step towards traffic prediction in urban computing but different from existing projects in terms of predictive goals 7 conclusion we propose a hierarchical model which contains a bipartite clustering algorithm a multisimilaritybased inference model and a checkin inference algorithm to predict the checkoutin of each station cluster in a bikesharing system based on historical bike data and meteorology data we evaluate our model on four datasets from nyc and dc obtaining performances which are significantly beyond

provincial joint key laboratory of big data science and engineering changchun china 3 chongqing institute of changchun university of science and technology chongqing china wangpengcusteducn abstract accurate bikesharing demand prediction is crucial for bike allocation rebalancing and sta tion planning in bikesharing systems the bike borrowing and returning behavior exhibit strong spatiotemporal characteristics meanwhile the bikesharing demand is affected by the arbitrariness of user behavior which makes the distribution of bikes unbalanced these bring great challenges to bikesharing demand prediction in this study a usage pattern sim ilaritybased dualnetwork for bikesharing demand prediction called ffstgcn is pro posed interstation flow features and similar usage pattern features are

the accuracy of demand prediction for bikesharing specifically bai et al use a cascade graph convolutional recurrent neural network to extract spatiotemporal correlations between data and two multi layer lstm networks to represent external meteorological data and time meta separately 26 chai et al produce a multiview spatiotemporal framework to combine characteristics into one prediction model framework of predicting the bikesharing demand 27 alternatively some scholars have integrated gcn and attention mechanisms in a natural way to tackle the issue of incorporating irrelevant stations features in the prediction process because of inadequate or erroneous prior knowledge 2831 for example huang et al developed the temporal multi graph convolutional tmgcn network to capture the spatial topologies contained in the dynamic od graphs in terms of time and exploit the gan structure to overcome the high spar sity of od demands 32 furthermore considering both the data collected from the bikes them selves and the extended analysis data provides valuable insights for constructing a network to predict the demand for bikesharing 33 34 unfortunately user travel behavior varies across time and space resulting in cyclical and volatile changes in bikesharing supply and demand 35 36 the stochastic fluctuations of individual stations can interfere with the feature extrac tion and pattern learning of overall demand these models are insensitive to random fluctua tions and struggle to handle complex bikesharing datasets which leads to low prediction accuracy therefore it is essential to mitigate the stochastic volatility of bikesharing demand to improve the prediction accuracy and robustness of the models however most studies typically utilize independent modules such as convolutional net works recurrent neural networks and their variants to separately capture temporal and spa tial dependencies these studies capture dependencies between temporal and spatial factors in an ordered manner but they dont fully consider the dynamic spatiotemporal dependencies of the system as a result they are unable to tackle the delay in bikesharing demand caused by users dynamic borrowing and returning behavior moreover in practical systems infrequent user travel between adjacent stations results in a low correlation between them conversely distant stations may display analogous user usage patterns indicating an implicit correlation consequently extant studies predominantly emphasize localized effects neglecting the over arching system dependency and the stochastic nature of user borrowing and returning behav ior this disregard contributes to a diminished accuracy in prediction to comprehensively consider the randomness global dependency of the bikesharing sys

influenced by shortterm dependencies on recent historical flow data while also exhibiting daily periodicity dependencies longterm dependencies however when modeling objects at different scales using existing methods a series of pooling layers or other crosslayer operations can result in the loss of features to mitigate this loss of multiscale spatiotemporal features we have designed a multiscale

gap and local channel context aggregator are used to capture the global and local contexts of the shortterm inflow matrix separately then the local context is added to the global con text in the

these factors contribute to the random volatility of bikesharing characteristics however sta tions with similar bike usage patterns can reflect the borrowing and returning records of other stations in the same category during the same period hence identifying stations with similar bike usage patterns to reveal potential connections in bikesharing and mitigate the impact of stochastic volatility on feature learning is crucial for improving predictive performance the bike usage pattern similarity learning module which is applied to obtain similarity usage pattern features is composed of three parts temporal similarity calculator spatial simi larity calculator and spatiotemporal similarity calculator the temporal similarity calculator is leveraged which uses a metric namely dynamic time warping dtw 37 to calculate the similarity of bike usage patterns between stations in the temporal dimension then to cal culate the similarity of bike usage patterns in the spatial dimension we develop a spatial simi larity calculator using the pearson correlation coefficient 38 finally the spatiotemporal similarity calculator is introduced to fuse the similarity of spatial bike usage patterns and simi larity of temporal bike usage patterns to construct the similarity usage pattern feature temporal similarity calculator the temporal features of bikesharing demand are cru cial dynamic factors in analyzing the usage patterns of bikes at stations over the same time period the usage patterns of some bikesharing stations may exhibit similarities identifying stations that have similar bike usage patterns over a period of time and using these stations to reflect the borrowing and returning records of other stations in the same category during the same period would be beneficial for developing bikesharing demand prediction the dtw algorithm overcoming the constraint of requiring time series to have the same length when applying euclidean distance it has been widely

transportation systems bikesharing demand exhibits a complex spa tiotemporal correlation traditional bikesharing demand prediction learns the connections of stations by aggregating information from their neighboring stations however the borrow ing and returning behavior of users between stations establishes a hidden correlation between them which conveys more information than the connections between neighboring stations by aggregating information from this correlation to learn interstation features prediction performance can be significantly improved furthermore the usage of bikesharing at neigh boring stations can exhibit considerable variations due to temporal fluctuations in travel behavior and the distinct characteristics of the built environment on the other hand even for stations that are geographically distant from one another their bikesharing usage patterns may exhibit remarkable similarity if the correlations between similar stations can be accu rately captured and effectively incorporated into the prediction model it may significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of bikesharing demand prediction thus we employ a dual network structure to learn the hidden correlated features among stations based on their flow and usage patterns similarity in fig 8 we present the bikesharing demand prediction module which consists of two key components flowbased feature learner and patternbased feature learner then the extracted features are utilized by the bikesharing demand prediction to realize the final prediction flowbased feature learner the borrowing and returning behaviors of users establish flow connections between stations the greater the flow between stations the stronger their interdependence by aggregating the characteristics of stations with strong correlations through flow relationships we can avoid introducing weak correlations thus improving the performance and efficiency of prediction however existing conventional aggregation func tions might not be suitable for capturing the flow characteristics of bikesharing data there fore we propose the ffl which is designed to extract the spatiotemporal correlations between bikesharing stations by analyzing the flow of bikes between them in the beginning we use i and o to construct flow graph specifically at time t it is expressed as gt nt et the node of graph is

results and discussion performance comparison we present a comparison of the overall accuracy achieved by our proposed model with that of several baseline models table 1 shows a comparison of the predicted errors of benchmark models and our model for predicting bikesharing demand on the bikeny dataset generally our proposed model consistently outperforms other benchmark models when it comes to prediction accuracy across the 15minute and 30minute time slots in the bikeny dataset notably our proposed model achieves a significant reduction of mse and mae by 3129 and 953 compared to the model with the outperformance in five benchmark models at 30minute time slot furthermore within a 15minute time slot compared to the bestper forming model among the five benchmark models our proposed model significantly reduced mse and mae by 972 and 258 respectively the results indicate that the hybrid model that couples gcn and lstm model to learn fea tures of bikesharing demand outperforms lstm in all time intervals this is due to the fact that lstm is a typical time series approach and it cannot exploit the spatial dependency of bikesharing demand among stations for prediction and it illustrates that capturing the spatial dependencies between stations facilitates improved prediction performance stsgcn has further improvement than stgcn this result could be due to the fact that stsgcn captures heterogeneity in local spatiotemporal maps mstgcn has a considerable improvement over stsgcn which demonstrates the importance of considering the usage pat tern similarity among stations and the effectiveness of multistructural network for capturing the spatial correlation nevertheless mstgcn is inclined to focus on dependency from neigh boring stations it cannot sufficiently consider the correlation on distant stations which have similar usage pattern consequently although mstgcn achieves good prediction results the performance of our proposed model is still better than it in all indicators the prediction accuracy of our model is much higher than mcstgcn across two time slots this is because compared to mcstgcn our proposed model encodes the longterm correlation

model only needs to predicate the overall demand for bikesharing within a specific region reducing data volume and computational complexity compared to the mstgcn model our proposed model considers both the spatiotemporal features of bike sharing usage patterns between stations and the spatiotemporal features of traffic between sta tions resulting in an overall more complex network architecture

the use of the dtw algorithm and pearson coefficient calculation in this module however increases the time complexity and computational costs of our model performance of models at stations with different bike usage levels satisfying users travel needs is one of the important tasks in the bikesharing system how ever the bikesharing demand is not evenly distributed in urban areas which results in a dis crepancy in the quantity of bikes present at various demand stations therefore if the demand and supply in stations with different usage patterns can be precisely predicted it is helpful for the bikesharing rebalancing problem we categorize the stations into four levels based on the hourly bike usage in the new york city bikesharing system to evaluate the models performance across these

7 2024 23 27 based on the results of prediction our model universally outperforms the five benchmark models across two time periods meanwhile we perform a comparative analysis with bench mark models on different stations and peak hours with varying levels of bike use the result of the predicted error reflects that our model has lower errors than other benchmark models in stations furthermore we design ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component in our model namely the multiscale spatiotemporal feature fusion module the bike usage pattern similarity learning module and the bikesharing demand prediction module the results of ablation studies show that flow features are more influential in prediction accuracy than similar bike usage patterns feature and the model with consideration of similar bike usage patterns yields more accurate prediction results than the model with only learning fea tures based on spatial neighbors the contribution of this research can be mainly summarized in the following three aspects 1 we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal feature fusion module to address limitations in multiscale spatiotemporal accuracy the feature training uses a msfa network to train longterm and shortterm features separately capturing the characteristics of bikesharing across various time slots then through feature fusion the shortterm and longterm features of bikesharing demand are integrated to provide more comprehensive and indepth spatio temporal feature for subsequent feature learners 2 we construct a bike usage pattern similar ity learning module to extract hidden correlated features among stations by doing so it can effectively reduce the influence of random fluctuations of individual stations on feature extrac tion enrich the features enhance the stability of the model and improve prediction accuracy 3 we have designed a bikesharing demand prediction model that employs a dual network structure containing flowbased feature learner and patternbased feature learner by the dual network structure to capture feature dependency then the output results of the two feature learners are comprehensively considered as the final prediction result consequently the ffstgcn model which considers multiscale features and multiple features can prevent the model from being affected by timelagged demand and supplydemand imbalances across sta tions it shows potential and promising capacity in bikesharing demand prediction however our research has limitations when it comes to complex bikesharing systems therefore our future work includes the following aspects 1 because bikesharing demand is affected by various external factors such as sudden events and weather we will analyze and introduce these external factors to predict bikesharing demand in extreme environments 2 we will consider more information about the users themselves such as age and occupation to analyze the riding habits of different user groups and improve the accuracy of the estimation results of the similarity of bike usage patterns at stations 3 we will use a bikesharing demand prediction model and find the optimal path between stations to save dispatching costs

help us to understand the travel characteristics of local people will facilitate trafc management and to a certain extent improve trafc congestion then the explanatory variables that help predict the demand for bike sharing were obtained using the granger causality with the entropy theorybased mic method to verify each other the multivariate temporal convolutional network tcn and gated recurrent unit gru model were integrated to build the prediction model and this is abbreviated as the tcngru model the tted coefcient of determination r2 and explainable variance score evar of the dataset reached 9842 and 9849 respectively meanwhile the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse were at least 198 and 24 lower than those in other models the results show that the tcngru model has strong efciency and robustness the model can be used to make shortterm accurate predictions of bikesharing demand in the region so as to provide decision support for intelligent dispatching and urban trafc safety improvement which will help to promote the development of green and lowcarbon mobility in the future keywords shortterm demand prediction bikesharing travel characteristics analysis hybrid tcngru model 1 introduction with the gradual improvement of peoples living standards and the enhancement of environmental awareness the series of negative social impacts brought about by rapid eco nomic growth such as trafc congestion environmental degradation and noise pollution caused by overloaded motor vehicle usage have undoubtedly led to an increasing demand for green and lowcarbon means of travel bikesharing has not only made a contribution to lowcarbon environmental protection but also alleviated the problem of human trans portation in the area of public transportation to a certain extent however the explosive growth and freerange development of bikesharing has also brought about a series of problems rst given the lack of supervision the excessive proliferation of bikesharing has caused a waste of resources and urban bicycle pollution second the lack of overall layout planning for bikesharing parking has led to the occupation of crowded public land third the freemoving bikes are unevenly distributed in time and space and their operation and maintenance is not timely entropy 2022 24 1193 httpsdoiorg103390e24091193

this phenomenon but the inuence of other elements in the bikesharing system is not considered thus there is a certain onesidedness and a limit to the ability to explain and predict the uctuation mechanism of bicycle travel demand 1 related studies have found that factors affecting the de mand for bikesharing rides include external factors such as weather air quality spatial location user price sensitivity and chance events in addition to historical data on travel demand 2 through a survey of bikesharing programs in beijing campbell et al 3 pointed out that the main factors affecting the demand for bikesharing are distance tem perature precipitation and air quality and that the users own demographic characteristics including income gender and occupation have no signicant effect on

for bicycles matton et al 4 pointed out that climatic conditions such as temperature wind and precipitation are the main factors affecting the demand for bikesharing and faghih et al 5 suggested that pointintime factors are also important variables affecting the demand for bikesharing including the time of day whether it is a weekend and peak hours in addition weather factors and pointintime factors 68 population den sity 910 the availability of bicycle lane facilities 1012 and distance to the urban cbd and universities 51013 are also related to the demand for bikesharing therefore some studies have started to incorporate external factors such as weather time factors and holiday factors into the independent variables of bikesharing demand pre diction li et al 14 established an lstm linear regression model considering the distance variable of users rides and the results of the study show that the prediction accuracy was improved compared with the existing time series prediction models li et al 15 proposed a prediction method based on a clustering algorithm with an augmented regression tree model based on weather conditions temperature and wind speed so as to predict the number of rentals and returns of bicycles at stations separately chen et al 16 argued that the demand for bikesharing is affected not only by general factors such as time and weather but also by contingent factors such as trafc events and proposed a dynamic clusterbased forecasting framework from the perspective of forecasting model development statistical methods such as the autoregressive integrated moving average model arima were rst applied to solve the bikesharing cycling demand forecasting problem statistical inferential forecasting methods based on statistics include traditional models such as arima models regression analysis and markov chains 17 andreas et al 18 developed a prediction model based on a differential sliding average autoregressive model using operational data from bicycle companies and data from bikesharing in the barcelona community to forecast the number of available bicycles at each bicycle station to investigate the characteristics and patterns of peak bicycle demand hours lin et al built an arima model 19 yan et al 20 considered both the temporal and spatial dependence of bicycle borrowing and returning demand for the time series the cyclicality and trend of bicycle travel demand were obtained by building an arima model considering seasonal patterns for the spatiotemporal dependence the intercluster transfer characteristics were portrayed by building a bayesian transfer network model zhou et al proposed a prediction method based on the markov chain model the study evaluated the model using data from the public bicycle system in zhongshan city the results of the case analysis verify the high prediction accuracy and generalization ability of the markov chain model 21 the traditional statistical methods are more sensitive to data and the presence of data noise can greatly reduce the reliability of model parameter estimation at the same time there is a certain degree of spatial and temporal dependence between the demand for bikesharing trips and external inuences such as weather and the prediction models based on statistical methods have weak explanatory power,"[101, 2005, 21066, 4717, 2239, 3802, 2632, 1018, 4197, 2041, 2008,

points one data point generated every hour ie 24 data points per day for the london area from 4 january 2015 to 3 january 2017 the dataset recorded the inuencing factors such as weather and travel time related to the demand of bikesharing we performed a data background gain by adding data nouns such as hour and month with timestamp information the descriptions of the data terms and examples are shown in table 1 22 data preprocessing since the dimensionality and magnitude of each variable are not uniform to eliminate the inuence of magnitude and to speed up model training the normalization method was used to normalize the data this involves a linear transformation of the original data entropy 2022 24 1193 4 of 22 that maps the data values to the 0 1 interval the transformation function

study did not conform to a normal distribution therefore we used spearmans rank correlation coefcient for measuring the linear correlation between the variables 32 the rank is the average descending

between these two variables is determined via equation 2 1 6 xi yi2 nn2 1 2 the spearmans rank correlation coefcient ranges within 1 1 when the absolute value is close to 1 this indicates that the two variables are more strongly correlated when the value is positive if one of the two characteristics shows an increasing trend the other also tends to increase and when the value is 1 it indicates a perfect positive correlation when the value is negative if one of the two characteristics tends to increase the other tends to decrease and when the value,"[101, 2685, 2028, 2951, 2391, 7013, 2296,

weather 33 31 bikesharing travel time characteristics analysis 311 demand varies with the hours and months first we assessed the distribution of the demand for bikesharing in different months and the results are shown in figure 2 the demand shows an obvious single hump shape that develops with the month ie the demand for bikesharing in the area gradually increases from january until it peaks in july and it then starts to decrease month by month next we determined the distribution of bikesharing demand at different times of the day and the results are shown in figure 3 the demand shows an obvious doublehump shape that develops with the time of the day that is the demand for bikesharing in the area is high at 7 and 8 am and 5 and 6 pm this result coincides perfectly with peoples commuting time to and from work on weekdays and also reects that bikesharing is in the highest demand when people commute to and from work suggesting that bikesharing can provide convenience for

the vast majority of months show a doublehump distribution of demand however in december demand for shared bikes increases when people are at work while demand is roughly the same throughout the

bicyclecentric environment figure 4 time bubble map of bikesharing demand it is known from the previous analysis that july is the month with the highest de mand for bikesharing so we took july 2016 as the research object and analyzed the daily demand changes in this month using heat maps and the statistical results are shown in figure 5 it can be seen that there is an obvious cycle pattern in the demand distribution with every seven days being a cycle and the demand distribution on five of the days cor responds to the weekday travel characteristics ie the obvious doublehump feature of on and off work this also reflects the obvious difference in the distribution of demand on weekdays and nonworking days there is a high demand for bikesharing on july 30 and 31 which may be related to the local prudential ride london event a popular ride that locals say turned london into a bicyclecentric environment figure 5 bikesharing demand time heat map figure 5 bikesharing demand time heat map 312 demand varies with working and nonworking days we found in the previous analysis that there is a signicant difference in the distribu tion of bikesharing demand between weekdays and nonweekdays therefore we took weekends and holidays as the research object and used weekday data for comparative analysis and the analysis results are shown in figure 6 it can be seen that the distribution of peoples travel characteristics on holidays and weekends is roughly the same on week days 800 and 1700 and 1800 are the peak times for car use which coincides with the time points for going to and leaving work in the case of nonworking days 14001500 is the real peak period of car usage this reects peoples preference for using shared bikes to travel in the afternoon during nonworking days 313 demand varies with the season in addition we analyzed the distribution of bikesharing demand by season at different moments of the day through line graph statistics the results are shown in figure 7 it can be seen that the trend of bikesharing demand is more or less the same in different seasons with higher demand in summer and autumn and the lowest in winter which is obviously related to the

for improvement in this study 1 the combined model proposed in this paper showed good results in shortterm bike sharing demand prediction and when we tried longterm prediction the results were not satisfactory later we will try to combine other models to improve performance in longterm prediction entropy 2022 24 1193 20 of 22 2 in this study we used a smallscale parametertuning method based on a grid search and subsequently we considered other optimization algorithms for parameter search ing which might improve the performance of the model 3 due to limited data conditions we were unable to obtain the main gathering locations of bikesharing in the region and thus could not extract spatial characteristics that could be used for further research following demand prediction 6 conclusions in this paper we built an accurate model that can be used for the shortterm predic tion of bikesharing demand using bikesharing data from 2015 to 2017 in the london area first we analyzed multidimensional bikesharing travel characteristics based on the explanatory variables such as weather temperature and humidity to understand the travel characteristics of local people and thus facilitate trafc management and to a certain extent improve trafc congestion considering the nonlinear relationship between each explana tory variable and bikesharing demand we used the mic method for variable selection where variables were then used as part of the model input and the experiments proved that adding explanatory variables could greatly improve the prediction performance of the model in addition considering the problems of overtting and poor stability that arise when using a single model on a small sample of data we proposed a hybrid multivariate tcngru model with the principle of the minimum error sum of squares and the model showed strong efciency and robustness this can facilitate the accurate shortterm pre diction of bikesharing demand in the region which in turn provides decision support for intelligent dispatching and urban trafc safety improvements it will also help to promote the development of green and lowcarbon mobility in the future this study focuses on the possible prediction of factors affecting future bikesharing in the london area by studying the time series data of bikesharing trafc demand probably due to sensitivity issues the data we obtained are limited and we have been unable to obtain the actual locations of the main concentrations of shared bicycles ie individual stations in the area it would be useful to conduct a more indepth study of intelligent scheduling if the researchers can obtain the specic cluster locations of shared bikes in this area author contributions conceptualization sz data curation cs and tw formal analysis xp

systems christian kapuku1 seungyoung kho2 dongkyu kim2 and shinhyung cho3 abstract new shared mobility services have become increasingly common in many cities and shown potential to address urban trans portation challenges this study aims to analyze the mobility performance of integrating bikesharing into multimodal trans port systems and develop a machine learning model to predict the performance of intermodal trips with bikesharing compared with those without bikesharing for a given trip using transit smart card data and bikesharing gps data from the city of seoul the results suggest that using bikesharing in the intermodal trips where it performs better than buses could enhance the mobility performance by providing up to 34 savings in travel time per trip compared with the scenarios in which bus is used exclusively for the trips and up to 33 savings when bikesharing trips are used exclusively the results of the machine learning models suggest that the random forest classifier outperformed three other classifiers with an accuracy of 90 in predicting the performance of bikesharing and intermodal transit trips further analysis and applications of the mobility performance of bikesharing in seoul are presented and,"[101, 26231, 19348, 17465, 2683, 2892, 2890, 2546, 4008, 2002, 1047, 9327, 1060, 14916, 1055, 3103, 1046, 2784, 21961, 4083, 2005, 3746, 5038,

discussed keywords bicycle transportation bikesharing modeling and forecasting pedestrians bicycles human factors planning and policy the core of the new multimodal urban mobility concept is to combine public transport with other motorized and nonmotorized transport as well as new mobility services this use of different and optimally combined transport modes within a trip is one of the key approaches for pro viding greater sustainability in urban transport 1 the integration of these new mobility services into existing multimodal transport systems may significantly affect the citys mobility such as increasing public transit attrac tiveness reducing demands for automobiles and parking space and reducing air pollution and traffic congestion bikesharing systems are among the nonmotorized shared mobility services that are being introduced in many cities these systems are the focus of this study many studies have demonstrated the advantages of integrating cycling with public transportation modes such as trains and buses 2 3 however the extent to which integrating bikesharing systems into a multimo dal transport system could improve the mobility of the city compared with other existing transport modes is still unexplored moreover with the multitude of travel options provided by the existing urban transport system the role and contribution of bikesharing should be assessed for example in many cities bus networks are typically designed to penetrate residential areas to the extent that bus stops usually are within walking distance of the vast majority of destinations feeder bus services are designed to pick up passengers and take them to a transfer point where they can transfer to one of the trunk 1department of civil and environmental engineering

already available it is necessary to understand the contribution that integrat ing bikesharing with the existing systems makes to the overall mobility to justify and prioritize investments in such systems this implicitly implies assessing the compe titiveness of multimodal alternatives that include bike sharing systems versus existing alternatives knowing where when and to what extent integrating bikesharing with the existing public transport system could provide higher mobility performance and allow planners to plan for highperforming integrated multimodal transport sys tems however the provision of such systems is proble matic without an understanding of the related factors and because of the lack of reliable tools that can be used to evaluate the performances of integrating these new mobility services into multimodal alternatives the terms intermodality multimodality and monomodality are often used in multimodal transport studies it is essential to define them to understand their use in this study according to chlond and manz the term monomodality can be defined as the exclusive use of one transportation mode for all travel within a specific time period 4 5 the term multimodality is the flex ible use of various transportation modes for travel within a specific,"[101, 6936, 3145, 22104, 10165, 5193, 18105, 18428, 3070, 11643, 1998, 19939, 2075,

time period typically 1 week intermodality however is a subset of multimodality that refers to com bining various modes of transportation in the course of one trip the multimodal transport concept used in our study is consistent with the definition of intermodality although the data used in our study were collected over several months the time period or travel unit in this study is single trips because our objective was to assess and compare different intermodal trips to determine the bestperforming alternative for a given trip we propose a method in this paper for analyzing the mobility performance of integrating bikesharing into multimodal transport systems to test the proposed approach we used transit smart card data bikesharing gps data and transitbikesharing transfer data from the city of seoul to develop an algorithm to extract inter modal alternatives the various features that may affect the choice probability were extracted from these alterna tives were ranked and selected using the relieff algo rithm using the selected features we built a machine learning model to predict potential bus itineraries in the multimodal system in which bikesharing can provide more efficient or competitive services the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the next section provides a literature review of earlier studies and positions our research this is followed by descriptions of the data variables and modeling methods then the results of the model and their possi ble implications are presented and discussed recommendations for future research are presented in the conclusions literature review early studies on multimodality in transportation were dedicated primarily to the interactions between automo biles and public transport to understand multimodal behavior 610 although being multimodal does not necessarily result in less car use indicators of the rela tionship between multimodality and more sustainable transport could be found from the literature for instance some studies revealed that individuals with more multimodal travel behavior patterns are more likely to change their travel behavior over time 1012 such behavioral change could allow an easier transition to sustainable transport if the right conditions are pro vided 12 it has also been found that a higher level of multimodality may lead to reducing co2 emissions under the condition that travel distance remains constant 13 the existing studies on bicycle intermodality with transit have been dedicated primarily to special forms of integrating bicycles with transit for instance a study found that most passengers chose walking bicycling and public transport to get to or from rail stations 14 a study in the us also found that walking was the pri mary means of transit access and egress followed by transit and automobiles bicycle access and egress trips combined with other modes accounted for only 22 and 26 respectively 15 ultimately all of the studies on the access to transit using bicycles fall into this cate gory even if they do not refer to intermodality because the underlying hypothesis is that improved bicycle access to transit may improve their intermodality with transit 2 3 1619 some other studies have compared the mobility per formance of bicycles and motorized,"[101, 2051, 2558, 4050, 1015, 2733, 6970, 5302, 9305, 3012, 2174, 2003, 1037,

modes based mainly on the descriptive analysis 2022 many other studies on shared mobility services have posited that shared mobility services have the potential to fundamentally reshape urban mobility by enhancing public transit decreasing car ownership and decreasing the overall transportation cost 23 a few studies are currently emerging to study the impact of shared mobility on the transportation system for example jiao et al used the 2017 national household travel survey to assess the association between shared mobility services including ridehailing services bikesharing services and carsharing services and individuals trip making behaviors 24 henrik et al conducted a joint simulation of carsharing bikeshar ing and ridehailing for a cityscale transport system kapuku et al 205 using matsim to assess the welfare impacts of shared mobility and mobility as a service maas 25 despite the intense discussion about the potential ben efits and disadvantages of shared mobility little research has attempted to conduct empirical assessments of their effects on existing systems this is primarily because of the lack of highquality data as many of these services are operated by private companies reluctant to share data 26 as a result there has been little research done on assessing the contribution of cycling as a shared mobility service in a multimodal transport system although this need has been acknowledged in the literature 1 2628 this paper aims to fill this gap by making the follow ing contributions 1 we propose a method for assessing the citywide mobility performance of bikesharing in the multimodal urban transport system using the available citywide revealed preference data 2 we develop a machine learning model for predicting the performance of multimodal alternatives that include bikesharing in the multimodal transport network 3 we propose a method for extracting competing multimodal alternatives from the dataset 4 the proposed model can be used both in the planning and operation stages to suggest highperforming intermodal itineraries for transit and bikesharing users model specification data description the city of seoul in south korea was the

bikesharing to bus and bike sharing to subway trips intermodal trips that use buses to connect to other transit modes are in the smart card dataset therefore we developed an algorithm that uses these two datasets to extract comparable and competing intermodal alternatives that used bikesharing or buses to connect to other transit modes the algorithm was used to identify alternatives bus subway and busbus directly comparable to transit bikesharing transfer trips the algorithm uses the k nearest neighbor knn algorithm 30 to find the near est alternatives and focuses on the specific part of the intermodal trip the algorithm can be implemented as follows after using this algorithm and processing the data the final dataset included 120400 observations of pairs of intermodal trips with one of the pairs using bike sharing 60200 observations and the other using buses to access other transit modes 60200 observations in the next step after extracting intermodal alternatives and their features we analyzed and assessed the mobility per formance of intermodal trips that included bikesharing and those without bikesharing based on travel time we compared the cases in which lessperforming bus

and wilcoxon tests were used to make statistical comparisons of the samples for several scenarios machine learning model the aim of the modeling step was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the performance of multimodal trip alternatives that include bikesharing compared with those without bikesharing we defined this problem as a binary classification problem that consists of predicting the probability that trips with bike sharing will be more competitive than trips without bike sharing given the selected features of the alternatives we compared four popular machine learning classifiers to select the model with the best predicting power these models have either already been successfully used in transportation research or have shown promising results in other fields these models included logistic regression lr 6 support vector machine svm 31 decision tree dt 32 and random forest rf 32 before building our models we investigated the importance of features of intermodal alternatives that will be used in the models this paper employs the relieff algorithm for feature selection to identify influ ential subsets of significant predictors the relieff algo rithm 26 is an extension of the original relief algorithm 33 34 compared with the original relief algorithm the relieff can deal with multiclass problems and incom plete and noisy data it also performs well on the feature selection problem that includes interaction among fea tures and local dependencies some of the strengths or advantages of the relieff algorithm include its indepen dence on heuristics its loworder polynomial time in computation and noisetolerance and robustness to fea ture interactions 35 results and discussion multimodality result evaluation of the comparable alternatives extraction algorithm the selection of k 4 as in the knn algorithm was based on some sensitivity analysis figure 3 shows the number of matched observations for each value of k we found that increasing the number of k also increases the chance of more correct matchings the main source of mismatching may come from select ing od pairs that cannot be found in the smartcard such as od bus stops of opposite directions because most travelers would travel between bus stops that lead to the same direction toward their destination another source of mismatching could come from a selection of wrong bus stops by the algorithm in which trip ends do not match either of these k samples can be used for modeling as they are all observed trips found in the smartcard we chose k 4 as it provided more valid matched trips and enough to be used in our model in general the trips that were found using the compa rable alternatives extraction algorithm were taken by the users so their related information is accurate even so it is important to validate the results to verify their prag matism first we selected the four nearest bus stops to increase the likelihood of finding at least one od match with the smartcard data however if the distance between the bikesharing station and the bus stops is too long travelers might not consider competing or compa rable alternatives to provide more,"[101, 1998,

minimum and maximum distances were 25 m and 7617 m respectively thus we concluded that the bikesharing stations and the bus stops selected by the algorithm were within acceptable walking dis tances so they were considered comparable mobility performance by scenario the results of the one tailed ttest confirmed the alternative hypothesis that the travel times of intermodal trips that included bike sharing were considerably less than the travel times using figure 2 intermodal travel scenarios figure 3 number of matched trips by selected k in knearest neighbor 208 transportation research record

provide better and more competitive services than using buses as the means of accessegress to assess the bikesharing systems potential mobility performance we compared the cases in which less performing bus trips were replaced by bikesharing trips that provided better service in relation to travel time for the accessegress parts of intermodal trips three scenar ios were evaluated 1 bus

longer travel time were replaced by their corre sponding bikesharing trips with better performance shorter travel time for the same od we called the sample that resulted mixed modes as they include combined bikesharing and bus trips or bikesharing and subway trips and we compared this sample with the sample of travel time that only included buses the ttest and wilcoxon statistical tests also

suggests that on average bike sharing and bus trips provide comparable levels of mobi lity on average the difference was very small that is only a 1 saving in travel time for more insight figure 4a

this paper analyzed the mobility performance of inte grating bikesharing into the multimodal transport sys tems based on travel time we developed machine learning models to identify and predict highperforming intermodal trips that include bikesharing compared with those without bikesharing for a given trip the results suggest that bikesharing could greatly enhance the mobility performance of the multimodal transport sys tem for many scenarios more specifically the results indicated that replacing lowperforming bus trips with highperforming bikesharing trips could provide a 34 reduction in travel time mixed modes scenario out performed the scenario in which all trips were made by bikesharing resulting in savings in travel time of about 33 this study has revealed important findings that could serve in planning and policymaking that aim to improve the mobility performance of multimodal transport sys tems first it has been demonstrated that bikesharing could provide a comparable or even better mobility level than buses in certain itineraries system variables such as bus detour bike lane speed and travel distance seem to be the best predictors of mobility performance rather than individual characteristics such as age and gender from a policy point of view these results have shown the potential of bikesharing in multimodal transport sys tems they have demonstrated the need to develop sus tainable transport policies such as providing more bicycle infrastructure and services to encourage shared cycling as a faster way to connect to other transit systems in multi modal trips especially in the itineraries in which their benefits are identified such policies could provide more environmentally friendly and faster transport options to transit riders which may minimize the use of automo biles for trips that aim to access main modes in multimo dal tours or trips the substitution of these bikesharing trips from automobiles could provide great environmen tal and health benefits considering that bikesharing is zero carbon emission compared with automobiles the,"[101, 5300, 4102, 2007, 1996, 10173, 5300, 4919, 3963, 1997, 1996, 2636, 2020, 18154, 3479, 1998, 2109,

proposed machine learning models can be used at the planning level to identify existing itineraries in which bikesharing can be introduced to enhance the mobility of multimodal systems for transit and bikesharing users for instance the models can be used to identify intermo dal trips in which the bus part of the trip can be replaced by highperforming bikesharing trips which may increase the mobility performance of the entire multimo dal system this can be a more efficient way of introdu cing new bikesharing services and a good reason for justifying investments in such systems at the operation level the proposed models could also be applied within various systems such as its maas and route planner apps to suggest intermodal alternatives enhanced by bikesharing systems this could increase the number of transit riders through highperforming services and may also have a positive effect on travelers behaviors this models application in a practical case study would be a good research topic for future investigations currently the model was trained only on intermodal trips which are often short for the accessegress part future research could include many types of alternative trips such as mono and multimodal trips including more than two modes to provide more findings on the predic tion performance future research can also improve the models prediction power by adding new variables and conducting testing in different environmental conditions such as different seasons bad weather and different times of the day finally the transferability of the model both in relation to the nature of the data and the use of proposed approach in other regions remains another area for future studies author note seungyoung kho and dongkyu kim is affliated to department of

maximum entropy reconstruction a b s t r a c t we study the problem of predicting the future availability of bikes in a bike station through the moment analysis of a pctmc model with timedependent rates given a target station for prediction the moments of the number of available bikes in the station at a future time can be derived by a set of moment equations with an initial setup given by the snapshot of the current state of all stations in the system a directed contribution graph is constructed and a contribution propagation method is proposed to prune the pctmc so that it only contains stations which have significant contribution to the journey flows to the target station once the moments have been derived the underlying probability distribution of the available number of bikes is reconstructed through the maximum entropy approach we illustrate our approach on santander cycles the bikesharing system in london the model is parameterized using historical data from santander cycles experimental results show that our model outperforms a timeinhomogeneous markov queueing model with respect to several performance metrics for bike availability prediction 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved 1 introduction in recent years we have seen significant growth of bikesharing programs all over the world 1 public bikesharing systems have been launched in many major cities such as london paris and vienna indeed they have become an important part of urban transportation which provides improved connectivity to other modes of public transit the concept of bike sharing systems is rather simple the system consists of a number of bike stations distributed over a geographic area city each station is equipped with a limited number of bike slots in which public bikes can be parked when users arrive at a station they pick up a bike use it for a while and then return it to another station of their choice with the increasing popularity of the smart transport theme there has been great interest from the research community in the intelligent management of bikesharing systems topics include but are not limited to policy design 23 intelligent bike redistribution 46 and user

this paper is on the probabilistic prediction of the number of available bikes in stations having a predictive model is of vital interest to both the user and the system administrator the user can use it to identify likely origindestination stations between which a trip can be successfully made system administrators can use the model to undertake service level agreement checking and plan bike redistribution for stations which are likely to break the service level requirement in this paper we present a novel momentbased prediction model that can provide probabilistic forecasts for the number of available bikes in a bike station by representing the bikesharing system as a population continuous time markov corresponding author email addresses cfengimperialacuk c feng

pctmc with timedependent rates our model is explanatory as the dynamics of the system is explicitly given gast et al 8 show the benefits of predicting forecasting the entire probability distributions of possible bike availabilities in a station compared with previous models that were only able to produce point estimates often using timeseriesbased techniques 7910 however unlike 8 in which all the considered forecasting methods worked on the level of isolated stations our model also captures the journey dynamics between stations guenther and bradley 11 also provide a pctmc model with timedependent rates for bike availability prediction however there are several key differences between their model and ours firstly our model provides the full probability distribution of the number of available bikes in a station whereas their model only provides a point estimate secondly we use a model reduction method to prune our pctmc such that the significant journey dynamics with respect to the target station are guaranteed to be preserved however their model aggregates stations which are spatially close assuming that they have similar journey durations to the target station which causes the information about the emptiness and fullness of stations to be lost contribution we summarize the contribution of our paper as follows firstly a novel pctmc model with timedependent rates is presented to successfully capture the journey dynamics between bike stations secondly we propose a novel model reduction technique to prune the pctmc model based on the directed contribution graph with a contribution propagation method for a given target station for bike availability prediction as well as a correlation heuristic to reduce the size of odes for joint moments in order to achieve a fast moment analysis finally we reconstruct the underlying probability distribution of the number of available bikes in the target station using the maximum entropy principle based on a few moments generated from fluid approximation of the pctmc and show that the model has a better performance on a set of metrics for bike availability prediction compared with the markov singlestation queueing

moment analysis techniques used how parameters are estimated from data that is commonly available for bike sharing systems we also present the detail of a novel correlation heuristic to accelerating moment analysis of the reduced pctmc by a further reduction of joint moment odes more experiments have been undertaken and we have done further work on evaluating the reliability of the predictions including journeys involving multiple people the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the background material related to our work we briefly introduce the concepts of pctmc with timedependent rates and the markov queueing model for bike availability prediction which we use as a baseline comparison we also present our assumptions about the availability of data and the broad framework for fitting a model from the data in section 3 we present our pctmc model for the bikesharing scenario in detail and the model reduction techniques that we use to make fast evaluation feasible in the next section we show how to reconstruct the probability distribution of the number of available bikes using the maximum entropy approach section 5 presents the experimental results of our model on the london bikesharing system compared with the markov queueing model finally section 6 discusses possible extensions of our model and draws final conclusions 2 background in this section we present the modelling framework that we use for developing our basic model pctmc with time dependent rates and discuss the idea of the basic markov queueing model used in 8 which we use as a baseline model for comparison we also discuss the data typically available for bikesharing systems and how this can be used to parameterize the models 21 pctmc with timedependent rates a pctmc is a stochastic process which consists of a number of distinct agent populations and a set of transition classes the state of a pctmc is captured by an integer vector counting the number of each agent type the model evolves with the firing of transitions when a transition fires one or more agent populations are updated each transition is associated with a rate function which assigns a rate governed by an exponential distribution to the transition based on the current state of the pctmc in this paper we specifically consider timeinhomogeneous pctmcs in which transition rates are timedependent such models are suitable for systems which experience periods of different dynamics at different times of the day such as the bikesharing systems in which the direction of travel often reflects the daily commute specifically a pctmc with time dependent rates can be expressed as a tuple p x t x0 x x1 xn zn 0 is an integer vector with the ith 1 i n component representing the current number of an agent type si each xi takes values in a finite domain di z0 hence d n i1di is the state space of the model t 1 m is the set of transition classes of the form r x t d where 1 r x t r 0 is a timedependent

agents of type si due to transition is given by di i i 1 i n and the transition rate is r x t r x t1 if xi i i 1 2 n and t t1 r x t2 if xi i i 1 2 n and t1 t t2 r x tk if xi i i 1 2 n and tk1 t tk 0 otherwise as the state space of pctmc models is often very large or even infinite numerical techniques traditionally used for performance analysis based on a markovian approach are entirely infeasible stochastic simulation is feasible but deriving useful metrics such as mean variance and probability distribution of populations often requires an excessively large number of simulation runs thus making this approach extremely costly in terms of computational resources particularly when estimating full probability distributions over large state spaces in this paper we will adopt a much more computationally efficient approach to analyse the pctmc for the bikesharing model specifically let mx rn 0 r be a moment function then the moment described by m evolves according to the following set of odes 13 d dt emxt t e mxt d mxt r x t 1 with emx0 mx0 for instance if we set mx xi mx xi 2 mx xixj we can get the following set of odes to describe the first moment second moment and secondorder

exj r t dj exi r t di dj er 4 where we use xi as short for xit and r as short for r x t for convenience the above system of odes is not closed if there exist transition rates in the pctmc which are nonlinear functions of the population variables as then the equation for one moment can only be expressed in terms of higher moments as a consequence of this momentclosure methods 1416 must be applied to close the system of odes before it can be numerically solved however in this work all the transition rates in the pctmc for the bikesharing model are either constants,"[101, 2007, 2169, 6653, 1996,

queueing model 8 and we will use such a model as our comparator ie we will compare the predictions based on our time inhomogeneous pctmc model with predictions derived from a time inhomogeneous queueing model concretely the most straightforward way to evaluate the behaviour of a station is to analyse it in isolation in this case a station can be modelled as a time inhomogeneous markov mm1ci

therefore the arrival rate at other stations should be reduced hence we seek a more realistic model which captures the journey dynamics between stations 23 data on bike sharing systems in order to parameterize the model of this paper we need to be able to estimate the arrival and pickup rates it and it at each station i throughout the day this can be done in two main ways the first is to use the station occupancy data that is typically published online by operators in order to facilitate the planning of trips by users this data can be logged manually 1 resulting in a dataset of station occupancy changes at the time points at which the server was queried this can be sufficient for estimating it and it although both may be underestimated since a bike removal and arrival between two queries will cancel each other out a second approach is possible when in particular for vlib in paris and santander cycles in london operators are willing to share a more refined dataset of all the individual journeys which allows for far more accurate estimation of the model parameters we use the second approach for the london dataset which contains journey data between 751 stations in section 5 some caution in choosing what data to include for parameterization is necessary since in reality the arrival and departure rates of bikes are dependent on several other factors than just the time of day these include the daytoday weather seasonal effects and whether a day is a working day or not to illustrate this we have displayed the difference between weekday and weekend usage patterns in fig 2 it is clearly visible that the weekdays have pronounced rush hour peaks whereas during the weekends the bikes are used most intensively during lunch time to limit these external factors we have only used data from the winter and early spring for the experiments and excluded weekends and holidays 1 for an example of a service that aggregates this type of data for different bikesharing systems see

is the expected journey duration in the following presentation we discuss the prediction of the number of available bikes at time t h but it is clear that the prediction of the number of available slots at the journeys end can be treated analogously 31 a naive pctmc model in the pctmc model we can identify three kinds of agents that determine the state of the system bikes in stations slots in stations and bikes which are en route between stations these are represented as agent types bikei sloti and journeyi jpl journey durations are generally not exponentially distributed so we fit the journey duration to a phase type distribution where for the journey from station i to station j we have pi j identical phases each with rate pi jdi j where di j is the mean journey duration to faithfully represent the journey dynamics between bike stations in a bikesharing system with n stations we first propose a naive pctmc model which contains the following transitions bikei sloti journeyi jp1 at itpi jt i j 1 n journeyi jpl journeyi jpl1 at pi jdi j journeyi jpl 1 l pi j i j 1 n journeyi jppi j slotj bikej at pi jdi j journeyi jppi j i j 1 n where bikei sloti represent a bike and a slot agent in station i respectively journeyi jpl represents a bike agent which is currently on a journey from station i to station j at phase l it is the fitted bike pickup rate governed by an exponential distribution in station i at time t and pi j is the probability that a journey will end at station j given that it started from station i at time t s denotes the population of an agent type s obviously the above model is not scalable even for solution by simulation since the total number of bike stations n is usually very large for example there are around 750 bike stations in london it is computationally infeasible to analyse a model which captures the full set of bike stations fortunately since we are only interested in the prediction of bike availability at a single target station at a time we only need to model stations which have a significant contribution to the journey flows to the target station knowing the state of a station which has a very small contribution to the journey flows to the target station will have negligible impact on the accuracy of bike availability prediction for the target station thus a directed contribution graph together with a contribution propagation method is proposed to automatically identify the set of stations which need to be modelled with respect to a given target station for bike availability prediction c

given target station v 1 2 n for bike availability prediction concretely we first need a way to quantify the contribution of one station to the journey flows to another station specifically we let cij denote the contribution coefficient of station j to station i which quantifies the contribution of station j to the journey flows to station i one station can contribute to the journey flows to another station both directly and indirectly the definition of a direct contribution coefficient at time t is given by the following simple formula cijt j itit in which j it represents the bike arrival rate from station j to station i at time t and it j j it then it is clear that cijt 0 1 0 jicijt 1 with the definition of the directed contribution coefficient we can construct a directed contribution graph for the bike sharing system at each time slot of a day the definition of the directed contribution graph is given as follows definition 1 at an arbitrary time t the directed contribution graph for a bikesharing system at this moment is a graph in which nodes represent the stations in the system and there is a weighted directed edge from node i to node j if cijt 0 and in this case the weight of the edge is cijt in particular note that the direction of edges is the inverse of contribution flows fig 3 shows a sample directed contribution graph which consists of six bike stations only for illustration purposes in a real case the graph will be more connected for those stations which are not directly connected in the directed contribution graph by using a contribution propa gation method we can evaluate the indirect contribution coefficient of one station on the journey flows to another station specifically the indirect contribution coefficient is quantified by a path dependent coefficient cij t which is the product of the direct contribution coefficients along an acyclic path from node i to node j cij t kl cklt intuitively cij t measures the estimated contribution of station j to the journey flows to station i propagated through the path more specifically taking the graph in fig 3 as an example suppose station i is the target station then the contribution of station j to the journey flows to station i has to propagate through its direct contribution to station m station ms direct contribution to station k and finally reach station i through station ks direct contribution doing so this indirect contribution is estimated by the product of the direct contribution coefficients along the path ik km mj to capture this diminishing propagation effect furthermore for the purpose of model reduction we assume any contribution either direct or indirect to the journey flows to the target station which is less than a specific threshold is insignificant then we can characterize the contribution coefficient of station j to station i by the maximum of the path dependent coefficients cijt max all paths cij t if there exists a path from node i,"[101, 2445, 4539, 2276, 1058, 1015, 1016, 1050, 2005, 7997, 11343, 17547, 5509, 2135, 2057, 2034, 2342, 1037, 2126, 2000, 24110, 27351, 1996, 6691, 1997, 2028, 2276, 2000, 1996,

indirect contributions to the journey flows to the target station is important because indirect journey flows with significant coefficients can largely decide the emptiness of the stations which have a significant direct journey flow to the target station thus can cause considerable impact on the overall journey flow to the target station furthermore we choose to characterize contribution coefficients by the maximum instead of the sum of path dependent coefficients because we only want to model stations which have at least a significant direct or indirect journey flow to the target station to model stations which have many insignificant journey flows to the target station is costly but can have limited impact on the predictions moreover the maximum of path dependent coefficients has the nice property that if i v and cvi cvi then for a station j which is on the path it is certain that cvj thus j v as a result for all stations which have a significant journey flow to the target station that journey flow will certainly be captured in the resulting reduced pctmc in contrast this property would not be preserved if we use the sum of path dependent coefficients for example in fig

however since cil 055 station l will not be included in the reduced pctmc as a result cij 055 will not actually be satisfied in the reduced pctmc after station l is excluded as an illustration of the

for the reduced pctmc for the first m order of moments the reduced pctmc has significantly fewer population variables than the naive pctmc however we may still face a large number of moment odes which are slow to analyse especially for realtime bike availability predictions when m is large thus in order 2 this information is actually recorded for the london bikesharing system c feng et al performance evaluation 117 2017 5874 67 fig 5 the correlation graph of a moment variable ex1x2x3 to accelerate moment analysis of the reduced pctmc we propose a correlation heuristic to achieve a further reduction on the size of the moment odes for the reduced pctmc utilizing the neighbourhood relation between population variables which is firstly introduced in 16 concretely we observe that most of the derived odes are used to describe the evolution of joint moments of population variables for instance suppose m 2 then there will be 2 n odes to describe the evolution of exi and exi 2 n2 n2 odes to describe joint moments exixj for all i j 1 2 ni j where n is the number of population variables in the reduced pctmc clearly the number of odes for joint moments grows exponentially as m increases therefore our strategy is to reduce the number of odes for joint moments to accelerate moment analysis specifically for each distinct moment variable exm ex m1 1 x mk k that appears in the left hand size of the derived moment odes for the reduced pctmc we construct a correlation graph for it the definition of a correlation graph is given below definition 2 the correlation graph g of a moment variable exm is a graph in which there is a node for each population variable xi that appears in the expression of the moment variable moreover there is an edge edgexi xj between two nodes if and only if t such that di 0 j 1 dj 0 i 1 where j is an indicator equal to 1 if and only if xj is updated after transition dj 0 or xj appears in the rate function r x t of intuitively this means that two population variables xi xj are connected in the correlation graph if there exists a transition in the reduced pctmc in which one of the two population variables is updated and the other is also involved more specifically a connected pair of population variables in the correlation graph are referred to onehop neighbours in 16 empirically it has been shown that only capturing the correlation between onehop neighbours can achieve similar accuracy with moment analysis which captures the correlation between all population variables in a pctmc we refer to 16 for more details by definition the

connected xi i xj i xi and xj are not connected fig 5 illustrates the correlation graph of a moment variable ex1x2x3 which consists of two correlation islands each correlation island in a correlation graph represents a decoupled moment variable with a lower order than the moment variable represented by the correlation graph thus with the identification of correlation islands in a correlation graph we can decouple the moment variable for joint moment ode reduction specifically let exm ex m1 1 x mk k be an arbitrary moment variable that appears on the left hand side of a moment ode g be the corresponding correlation graph and i be a correlation island in g we can approximate exm by the following formula exm ig e xii x mi i according to the above formula for a moment variable exm which appears on the left hand side of a moment ode if its correlation graph consists of more than one correlation island then this moment ode can be eliminated since it can be approximated by the product of moment variables with lower orders after the reduction of joint moment odes using the above method we can achieve a much faster moment analysis of the reduced pctmc for the bikesharing model the

as the markov queueing model the remaining 110 data is used to test their prediction accuracy as in 11 we fit the number of journey phases between stations using the hyperstar tool 28 command line interface specifically we set the maximum value of pi j to 20 to make our model compact and also to avoid overfitting moreover for parameter estimation we split a day into slots of 20 min duration in our experiments given the bike availability in a station at time t we predict the probability distribution of the number of available bikes in that station at time t h where h is set to 10 min for short range prediction and 40 min for long range prediction the evaluation of our model is twofold the first is accuracy the second is efficiency these two aspects are both influenced by the value of

moving average arima model which is commonly used to provide point prediction for bike availability in stations 711 specifically let yit yi1 yi2 be a time series in which each element yit represents the number of available bikes at station i at discrete time step t we provide a spatialtemporal arimapdq model as follows for bike availability prediction yd i t p j1 j yd i t j knei p j1 k j yd kt j q j1 j it j it where yd i t denotes the dth differencing of yit to impose stationarity nei is the set of neighbour stations of station i for capturing spatial pattern correlation and the it are error terms which are assumed to be independent identically distributed variables sampled from a normal distribution with zero mean the j are the parameters of the autoregressive part of the model the k j are the parameters of the spatial pattern part the j are the parameters of the moving average part here we let the five nearest stations to denote the set of neighbour stations for any given station the values of p d q for each station are tuned to achieve best prediction accuracy all the parameters are fitted using the statsmodels python library 29 moreover like in 711 an observation frequency of 5 min is chosen to construct the time series thus in order to predict the number of available bikes in a station at 10 min later one needs to predict the number of available bikes at 5 minutes later first and then use the predicted number to estimate the number at the target time clearly we can also use this iterative approach to obtain the prediction of the number of available bikes at 40 min later table 2 compares the rmse of the prediction results of our pctmc model with the markov queueing model as well as the arima model as can be seen although the improvement of accuracy in the short range is not significant our pctmc model clearly outperforms both the markov queueing model and the arima model in the long prediction range this means capturing the journey dynamics provides more significant information for the long prediction range for the pctmc models smaller values of only reduce the rmse slightly this means capturing less significant journey flows will have little impact on the prediction accuracy moreover we find that the derived highest moments have almost no impact on the rmse this is obvious since the expected number of available bikes is only decided by the first moment 52 probability of making incorrect recommendations predicting the expected number of available bikes is important for system administrators when they want to decide how to redistribute bikes in the system however users are interested in whether there are at least n bikes in the target station when they want to pick up n bikes from there we are specifically interested in

of that station having more than n bikes is greater than a threshold value p and respond no if the predicted probability of that station having more than n bikes is less than or equal to p therefore we define pincorrect n as the probability of making incorrect recommendations for the will there be at least n bikes query pincorrect n p pxv n p xv n p pxv n p xv n where p pxv n p xv n is the probability of a yes prediction when the actual number of available bikes is less than n thus making an incorrect recommendation of yes whereas p pxv n p xv n is the probability of making incorrect recommendations of no a larger value of the threshold pmeans a more conservative policy for recommendations of yes for example p 0 means the policy will almost always recommend yes for the query whereas p 1 means the policy will always recommend no for the query in these two extreme cases using different prediction models will make no difference in fig 6 we show the probabilities of making incorrect recommendations for the will there be at least one bike and will there be at least two bikes queries using the markov queueing model mqm and our pctmc model with different parameters as a function of p where p0 01 02 09 letting p 1 makes no sense since it is useless to have an always no recommendation policy note that the arima model can only provide point prediction thus is excluded here the pctmc model with m 1 is also excluded since at least two moments are needed to make a meaningful reconstruction of the probability distribution it can be seen that it is generally more likely to make incorrect recommendations for the will there be at least two bikes query than the will there be at least one bike query using both prediction models furthermore we observe that for the short prediction range our pctmc model tends to have slightly lower probabilities of making incorrect recommendations for both queries compared with the markov queueing model while increasing p which makes the policy become more conservative for the long range prediction the difference between our pctmc model and the markov queueing model becomes more clear this means using our pctmc model can effectively improve the accuracy of bike availability recommendations compared with the markov queueing model moreover for the long prediction range we also find that increasing the value of m which makes the reconstructed probability distribution closer to the true distribution has a greater effect on improving recommendation accuracy than decreasing the value of so as to include more stations

as making an incorrect recommendation of no however in reality users are more likely to be frustrated when they are recommended to go to a station and find that there are not enough bikes there than when they are recommended to not go to a station when there are actually enough bikes available in that station thus the authors in 8 proposed a proper scoring rule in which correct recommendations will be awarded with a unique positive score and incorrect recommendations will be penalized by varying negative scores a key feature of a proper scoring rule is that it ensures that the most accurate prediction model can always be expected to obtain the highest score specifically it is proved in 8 that the following scoring rule is proper score 1 if pxv n 08 xv n 4 if pxv n 08 xv n 1 if pxv n 08 xv n 1 4 if pxv n 08 xv n in which we set the penalty scores for incorrect recommendations for yes and no recommendations to 4 and 1 4 respectively the threshold value pis set to 08 which is equal to p scoreincorrect yes scorecorrect yes scoreincorrect yes scoreincorrect no scorecorrect yes scorecorrect no the above scoring rule can be easily extended to the evaluation of the recommendations to

accurate prediction for point estimates as illustrated in section 51 for probability distribution predictions one should prioritize the choice of m since it has a greater impact on the accuracy of predictions as demonstrated in sections 52 and 53 in this case we assume that the time cost of making a prediction must be less than one second for real time application thus for point predictions we recommend to set 001 m 1 for both prediction ranges for probability distribution predictions we recommend to set 002 m 2 for short range prediction 003 m 2 for long range prediction note that we used an intel core i7 laptop with 8gb ram to run our experiments the time cost could be considerably reduced if a more powerful machine eg a server were used 6 conclusions we have presented a momentbased approach to make predictions of availability in bikesharing systems the moments of the number of available bikes are automatically derived via a pctmc with timeinhomogeneous rates fitted from historical data the entire probability distribution is reconstructed using a maximum entropy approach our model is easy to understand since it explicitly captures the dynamics of the bikesharing system we have demonstrated that it outperforms a spatialtemporal arima model for point estimates and the markov queueing model in several performance metrics for prediction accuracy moreover we have also shown that by using the directed contribution graph and the moment ode reduction method the model size can be significantly reduced to such an extent that it is suitable for realtime application in future work we plan to explore the impact of neighbouring stations and extend our model to capture their effects for example if a station is empty then the user is likely to pick up a bike from a neighbouring station thus increasing the pickup rate at the neighbouring station conversely if a station is full then the user is likely to return a bike to a neighbouring station increasing the bike arrival rate there we think another merit of our pctmc model is that it can be easily extended to capture such impact by using the indicator function to check whether a neighbouring station is empty or full in order to alter the bike arrival and pickup rate of a station 74 c feng et al performance evaluation 117 2017 5874 acknowledgement this work is supported by the eu project quanticol 600708

relations and interactions between the networks elements nodes we adopted the open source tool vosviewer httpswwwvosviewercom this tool was used to map in a series of semantic networks the keywords cooccurrence and coauthors cooccurrence in publications and allowed us to identify network properties such as clusters and node centrality moreover the tool calculates node links and weight showing each nodes importance in the network this allowed us to identify the main keywords authors coauthors and their respective relations within the slr data set for quantitative analysis several graphs were then created in vosviewer 11 depicting network clustering and centrality the size of nodes represents the degree of centrality the larger the node the more times it is mentioned in the slr data set in addition the thickness of edges represents the number of times two connected nodes are mentioned together indicating their relevance in relation to each other by default the networks are distributed from the largest to the smallest in the graph see figure 4 as an example this tool was used to analyse the data set on keywords cooccurrence and coauthors cooccurrence in the case of keywords combinations were ltered occurring only once in the network in the diagrams generated by the tool the bigger the size of a node the more frequently the keyword is used the thickness of the links between the nodes represents the number of times pairs of keywords occur the thicker the line is the more often the pair of words is used with respect to coauthors the same concept was applied the larger the node is the more publications the author has within this slr database for quantitative analysis and the thicker the line is between two authors the more often they collaborate within the timespan of the slr thickness of the line represents the number of publications they have together 3 results 31 prisma flow diagram a prisma ow diagram illustrates our process of slr data set

in this city are among those questions the two gaps pointed out offer an opportunity for further research to be addressed in future work 43 study limitation discussion our slr method has limitations of not being able to identify the literature outside the parameters given by the researcher the selected articles do not cover an exhaustive list of publications in the eld of machine learning techniques for bsss in fact the analysed literature is an initial map of the research elds from 2015 to 2019 with general trends and outlines of the main gaps in research related to the last technological features of a dockless bss research from previous years from 2008 onwards can also be of interest particularly with regards to the scope of the technological evolution of machine learning techniques applied to fourthgeneration bsss which are characterised by having docking stations future research in this domain may also benet from gathering data from more repos itories than the twoscopus and web of scienceselected for the purpose of this work our keyword selection for the publication search took a broader scope of machine learning techniques applied to bsss future research might benet by looking at specic machine learning techniques especially prediction models applied to bsss 5 conclusions the prisma methodology outlined the slr and created an organised view of machine learning techniques applied to bsss for future information retrieval recent technological developments in stationfree bsss fuelled new research in the last couple of years with contributions to service improvement in urban mobility our survey showed that in the latest bss studies classication and prediction prob lems are the two issues mostly addressed by machine learning techniques clustering analysis is mainly used to explore bss spatiotemporal patterns at different city scales hierarchical clustering is showed to be the most efcient algorithm to group sites with similar characteristics 33 unlike kmeans clustering which is best suited to rebalance bss usage patterns 26 the rf is a robust algorithm to discard outliers and noise and has an advantage of dealing with complex nonlinear and highdimensional data additionally it estimates the importance of the input variables of different factors the literature 37 showed that it has a more sophisticated accuracy rate compared to the multinomial logistic regression method in a latest study 33 an rf is mainly used to analyse general features of travel distance and time of bss trips our slr results suggest that lstm nns a deep learning technique are the recom mended model to be used to identify mobility patterns of the stationfree bss as well as for dynamic demand forecasting models able to predict the travel demand of stationfree bikesharing isprs int j geoinf 2021 10 62 23 of 25 given the identied knowledge gaps we can raise some recommendations for fu ture work within the overarching theme of machine learning techniques applied to bsss promising areas for further research lie in modelling the spatiotemporal dimension of bsss in urban mobility in analysing synergies with other transport

bikeshare experts successful and not so successful bikeshare systems and thought leaders so that new and expanding bikeshare systems are positioned to succeed it aims to shed light on every step of planning implementing and expandingas well as regulatinga bikeshare system taking into account a citys location size density existing transportation network and other features so much has been learned since the release of the first bikeshare planning guide in 2013 new innovative technologies business models funding mechanisms and policy strategies have emerged over just a few years given these changes and in some cases the uncertainties they have generated this edition will take a more descriptive approach to system planning arming cities with knowledge on the planning design management and funding options available to them as well as potential outcomes yields more successful bikeshare systems and more sustainable transportation networks bikeshare has taken many forms over the past decade from free bikes distributed throughout a community for all to use to stations where bike rental was managed manually by an attendant to the more technologically advanced and secure systems we see in most cities today the purpose of bikeshare though has always remained the same enabling users to pick up a bike in one place and return it to another making pointtopoint human powered transportation practical the what is simple the how is where it gets complicated myriad of variables must be taken into account when planning a bikeshare system the citys density topography and weather its commitment to investing in infrastructure and its political will to support active transportation for example many cities have developed and expanded around car travel sacrificing

bikeshareeuropean transitcentered bikeshare systems have operated using a stationless model for yearsa new generation of dockless also called stationless or freefloating systems exploded on the scene in 2015 thanks to dozens of private startup companies that expanded rapidly across china and in cities around the world the ne w dockless model offers a more flexible bikeshare experience because users are able to start and end their trip at their true origin and destination without having to find a nearby station dockless bikes are equipped with global positioning systems gps and are found rented and locked through the dockless operators smartphone app these systems have the potential to produce robust travel data generated from the onbike gps pertrip pricing annual membership and 24hour passes have been a hallmark of bikeshare pricing schemes since their inception but few systems offered users a more flexible less expensive pertrip price this fare optionusually the equivalent of us3 or less and sometimes considerably lessis now offered by both traditional stationbased systems including capital bikeshare in washington dc biketown in portland or and bixi in montreal and dockless systems similar in price to a trip on public transit the pertrip fare is intended to generate trips on bikeshare that otherwise would have been made walking or using transportation network companies tncs in paris dockless bikes from multiple private operators have become popular and supplement the citys stationbased system velib source carlos f pardo itdps first edition of the bikeshare planning guide was released in 2013just as several innovative gamechanging technologies were beginning to hit the bikeshare scene several of these developments introduced below but covered in detail throughout the guide have challenged existing financing pricing and operating models catapulting bikeshare toward a new generation 111 developments since the 2013 planning guide 7 pedal assist ebikes these bikes also called pedal electric pedelec provide a batterypowered boost to riders as they pedal pedal assist bikes are particularly ideal for bikeshare because of their otherwise high upfront cost to users and they can improve user comfort by reducing oftencited barriers to cycling such as fatigue sweating and longerdistance or hilly trips maximum speeds for pedal assist ebikes are usually capped at around 30 kph 18 mph hybrid bikeshare systems in an effort to embrace new technological developments while still offering users a bikeshare system they understand and feel comfortable using several cities integrate different types of bikes and docking options into one system for example barcelonas bicing and milans bikemi offer users access to smart dock bikes as well as pedal assist

funding scheme for bikeshare in july 2017 113 the need for outcomeoriented decision making emerging innovations and technologies in transportation have generated new mobility opportunities namely eliminating barriers to the success of shareduse transportation a key piece in the sustainable transportation puzzle shareduse transportation defined as mobility assets that are shared amongst users such as bikeshareing ride hailing microtransit etc is becoming increasingly important for cities as they work to reduce private vehicle travel and reclaim public space for people goalsetting can help to integrate bikeshare into a citys economic development sustainability health and other efforts already being undertaken for example bikeshare can plug into climaterelated goals as a tool to reduce vehicle kilometers traveled vkt and singleoccupancy vehicle trips or it can contribute to economic development goals by attracting both tourists and businesses offering an affordable sustainable transportation mode for visitors to explore the city and as a quality of life benefit for potential employees identifying goals for bikeshare will help cities decide which policies to prioritize and how best to track progress and measure success data generated from bikeshare trips will help inform this evaluation and collecting it from operators will be paramount for cities going forward this planning guide encourages vision and outcomeoriented policies instead of identifying specific operating or business models this allows for greater flexibility in shared mobility policy solutions as contexts opportunities and technologies evolve 10 12 the opportunity of bikeshare 121 expanding sustainable transport through network integration welldesigned bikeshare systems around the world have provided critical links to transit jobs and other destinations thereby expanding cities transportation networks and connecting people to new opportunities public transportation as cities consider reframing their transportation network as a service that maximizes ease and efficiency for users opportunities emerge for bikeshare to be seamlessly integrated into the larger transit system while this may or may not translate into increased ridership integration between transit and bikeshare would contribute to a better more seamless transportation network an april 2016 study conducted by the united states bureau of transportation statistics found that 77 of all bikeshare stations in the us were located within one block of another public transit mode thereby meaningfully extending the network8 bikeshare stations near bus stops were the most common transit connection additional connectivity could be gained through onboard stop announcements that alert riders of nearby bikeshare connections as has been implemented in milwaukees buses with connections to the citys bublr bikeshare several cities including los angeles mexico city and montreal have had success implementing lite transit integration linking per trip and annual bikeshare membership payments with their existing transit cards through rfid9 on the back end however the user maintains two separate accountsone for bikeshare and one for transiteach with its own payment system robust transit integration however is characterized by the use of a single payment platform that enables users to access bikeshare and transit seamlessly bikeshare operators concerns about liability complicate the issue since the transit card would need to be linked to a credit card or bank account that would be charged if a,"[101,

to access rideshare and bikeshare through one app has interesting implications for shared mobility and mobility as a service reducing barriers to shared mobility modes makes these modes easier for users to choose and link together offering more robust alternatives to using a private vehicle cities should be aware that this type of partnership could occur and have clear data sharing requirements in place for both tncs and bikeshare operators in order to gain insights into how and why people are using certain modes for certain types of trips informal transit in many developing cities informal transit modes such as cycle taxis rickshaws and motorbikes provide affordable firstlastkilometer connections for commuters and other travelers depending on the size of the service area a bikeshare system could directly compete with these informal modeson the one hand addressing some of the challenges brought about by informal transit such as congestion traffic crashes air pollution etc but on the other generating conflict with existing operators if demand is not high enough to sustain them more than likely the unmet demand for firstlastkilometer connectivity will enable bikeshare to complement existing informal transit options cities in which people rely heavily on informal transit should make a point to be transparent with existing operators about how and where the bikeshare system will operate and discuss options for their inclusion in the system where possiblefor example creating positions to assist new bikeshare users with operating the system and to provide security this type of transition for informal operators has been discussed in cairo which plans to launch a bikeshare system in 2019 cities can also undertake efforts to transition former informal transit operators into new jobs created by the bikeshare systems direct operation including in cleaning maintenance and rebalancing activities indirect employment opportunities through the establishment of bicycle shops bicycle tourism and related activities may also arise however while local governments should take conversations about how a new bikeshare system might impact informal transit operators seriously the ultimate goal of bikeshare is to provide a safe reliable affordable transportation mode for the public and cities should not compromise that goal to appease informal operators bikeshare can be a key component of transportation plans that include a longterm vision for cycling because bikeshare reduces some barriers to cycling it can help quickly boost the number of cyclists on the road this in turn can generate a political constituency that supports comprehensive infrastructure and other investments that ingrain bicycling into the transportation system for example in california

legallybinding climate action plan to increase the share of bike commuters from 2 to 6 by 2020 and to 18 by 2035 is reworking its bikeshare system to better serve commuters13 the city relocated 15 stations which had previously served mostly tourists along the beach to neighborhoods more connected to public transit and biking infrastructure at the same time the transportation department committed to build more bike lanes and pedestrian greenways in downtown san diego rosario argentina passed municipal ordinance 9030 in 2012 which established the citys public bikeshare system article 6 of the ordinance calls for segregated cycle facilities to connect bikeshare stations to one another and for these facilities to be built out as the system expands14 while these lanes benefit bikeshare users they can be used by all cyclists and contribute to a safer more comfortable riding experience as of 2017 rosario has 120 km of protected bike paths compared to washington dc which has

riders so why isnt there more diversity of races and socioeconomic statuses among bikeshare users bikeshare systems to date have been criticized for not serving cities in an equitable way with their initial cohort of stations often located in the downtown core and surrounding higher income neighborhoods additionally few systems offered alternative payment options for users without bank accounts often referred to as unbanked or those without credit cards this approach aims to ensure the financial stability of the systembuilding awareness and ridership revenue in the densest areas before spreading the system to lower density neighborhoods however it often results in transitunderserved lowincome populations having little to no physical access to the bikeshare system and a less tangible

service area and the convenience and usability of the system number of stations per square kilometer number of trips per bike are important to track22 with this in mind cities should communicate to bikeshare operators both their equity goals and the data points needed to measure progress toward those goals integrating bikeshare into existing citywide goals and establishing metrics to track progress toward those goals is discussed in detail in section 31 identify goals for bikeshare historically underserved communities can be wary of bikeshare or more likely what bikeshare has represented in other citiesgentrification for example gentrification fears in a historically latino district of san francisco led to that neighborhood refusing to approve ford gobike stations along a major street23 local residents did not feel included in the system rather they saw bikeshare as a means of ushering in newer wealthier residents a bikeshare system planned around equity may lessen such concerns and should focus on more than just siting stations in low income neighborhoods a truly equitable system should integrate equity into its hiring practicesfor system staff and vendorsas well as ensure that community outreach and promotional efforts are organized with input andor direct involvement from champions and advocates from target communities 18 atlantas relay and philadelphias indego systems have been particularly successful in empowering local champions to help introduce communities of concern andor low income neighborhoods to bikeshare in canada hamilton ontarios bikeshare system has focused directly on equity since its inception and offers a variety of options to reduce traditional barriers to bikeshare for example users can pay per minute for a trip which can be perceived as a better value because you only pay for what you use or a per month price for unlimited 90minute ridesreducing the potential for unpredicted usage fees that for most systems accrue after 30 minutes hamilton bikeshare also allows users to access the system using a prepaid card which can be easier to obtain for lowincome residents as opposed to a credit or debit card compared to other canadian bikeshare systems hamiltons system is the only one in which a majority of the service area is made up of highly socioeconomically deprived dissemination areas equivalent to us census block groups indicating that hamilton bikeshare does largely serve lowerincome residents it is worth noting however that a high density of lowerincome neighborhoods have been historically located in and around hamiltons downtown core enabling the initial bikeshare service area to capture the density it needed to be financially viable while also achieving more equitable service delivery24 implementing a more equitable bikeshare system that includes for example payment alternatives for people without credit cards or a local ambassador program can present additional financial and logistical costs for the bikeshare implementing agency and operator cities should consider reaching out to collaborations like the better bikeshare partnership which leverages funding to address

city rather it is a tool for making a city better to get the most benefit from bikeshare cities should identify specific goalssuch as increasing access by cycling and public transport or reducing greenhouse gas emissionsthat bikeshare can help achieve and identify performance metrics to monitor progress toward those goals choose a system type and define planning and policy parameters section 32 informed by the citys goals as well as contextual characteristics of the city ie hilly existing cycling culture etc the next step is to identify which type of system to pursue docked dockless or a hybrid approach the locations and sizes of stations andor service area boundaries key planning parameters related to system size and projected ridership should be defined as well as policies to guide bikeshare operations develop business and financial plans section 33 this step defines the organizational and revenue models including contracting or permitting and enforcement the time frame for each step will differ from city to city depending heavily on political will staff time and resources committed to the project the time frame for publicly funded systems typically stationbased will likely be longer than private dockless systemsoften more than a yearbecause of tendering and contracting operations which are dictated by the citys procurement rules if any are in place regardless the time frame for planning and implementing a bikeshare system is far shorter than that of most transportation projects and can be realized within a couple of years or within a mayoral term 31 identify goals

detail about what types of goals bikeshare can help achieve see section 12 the opportunity of bikeshare 311 establish metrics to evaluate performance once cities establish qualitative goals for their bikeshare systems they should define metrics to track progress toward those goals to meet the performance metrics described below a certain number of bikes will need to be in service this can help cities make initial estimates about fleet sizes in addition to evaluating performance after the system has launched data from operators will be critical to performing these evaluations and cities should establish data sharing standards that operators agree to meet prior to starting service see section 65 data requirements and management for more indicators if they do not already cities should begin to collect data on several indicators that estimate bikeshares broader effect on mobility and accessibility these indicators are not associated with a specific target instead cities should track progress over time in an effort to better inform policy choices but not necessarily operations the following are suggested indicators cities can of course track alternative indicators such as the percentage of short trips less than 5 km made by bike but this would require additional data collection capabilities paris hangzhou manchester greater manchester has a regional goal of increasing the

reasonably walk to a bike for dockless systems or station this can be done by downloading snapshots of the realtime service map at varying times each day a 500 m service area would then be created around each bike andor station and then the percent of lowincome defined by the city residents within that service area would be calculated averaging these together would yield the percent of lowincome residents near bikeshare performance metrics the following performance metrics enable cities to measure the utility and stability of a bikeshare system and compare system performance across multiple cities an efficient reliable and costeffective system will optimize two critical performance metrics average daily trips per bike target 48 daily uses per bike turnover is critical to a successful bikeshare system and this metric gets at how efficiently the bikes are being used fewer than four daily uses per bike can result in financial unsustainability for the operator ie user fees not able to cover cost to operate each bike while more than eight daily uses can indicate limited bike availability especially during peak hours new york city 64 barcelona 64 mexico city 54 and guangzhou 50 showed solid daily usage numbers in 2017 if bikes are not readily available to as many potential users as possible the system will not be viewed as a reliable mode that can replace or compete with other options such as private cars a high number of average daily trips per bike may indicate that there are too few bicycles in circulation more stations and bikes should be added to stationbased systems with high average daily uses per bike see subsection 412 station sizing for more while cities with dockless bikeshare systems with high average daily uses per bike should consider raising the fleet size cap if one is in place on the number of bikes per operator see subsection 422 for more on fleet size caps if a system has relatively few uses per bike this might indicate inefficient usage of infrastructure and low costbenefit likely because of a surplus of bikes a system with many bikes being ridden by a small group of users could result in the perception that bikeshare is not being used enough to justify its expense to the city in the case of publicly funded systems or justify its use of public space especially for privately operated systems if this is the case stationbased systems may want to consolidate andor decrease the size of certain stations similarly cities with multioperator dockless bikeshare systems that show few daily uses per bike may want to lower the cap on the number of bikes per operator or establish a cap if one is not already in use alternatively to broaden the user base and increase awareness of the system the city may want to bolster education and marketing campaigns existing barriers to ridership may help inform which of these two approachesfleet size reduction and encouraging ridershipwill be most successful for example if the city lacks sufficient biking infrastructure shortterm solutions like marketing will not address that issue,"[101, 16286, 3328, 2000, 1037, 7997, 2005, 8946, 3238, 3001, 2030, 2276, 2023, 2064,

expanded investments and land use dedicated to cycling a tool to help meet broader sustainability goals set by the city dockless bikeshare systems operated by private companies change the context around a feasibility studynamely because they do not have stations to sitehowever it is still strongly recommended that cities interested in pursuing a privatelyoperated dockless system first undertake a feasibility analysis items for analysis in addition to those for stationbased systems should include target fleet size andor number of operators location of geofenced hubs andor other dockless bike parking strategies integration among operators and with the rest of the transportation system and expected use patterns cities interested in transitioning from an existing stationbased system to a dockless system should also evaluate these topics even if a feasibility study was completed prior to the systems original launch furthermore for any type of system cities will need to understand whether they are an attractive market for private investments many cities are conducting requests for information rfis or requests for expressions of interest rfeis to evaluate whether private companies are interested and willing to invest and what those investments might look like this provides a more concrete understanding about what the private sector can actually provide and enables cities to weigh that option against a publicly operated system basic system metrics a range of local data must be collected and analyzed to complete a feasibility study the following data points are critical to establishing the basic framework for the feasibility studydefining the physical size of the area and the potential number of users service area the contiguous area in which a bikeshare system operates for stationbased systems and dockless systems with strict geofenced parking areas the service area is typically made up of a 500 meter radius around each station for dockless systems the service area is typically the jurisdictional boundaries of the city but could be defined however the government sees fit over time however the true service area of a dockless system may prove to be smaller than the whole city and could be further defined based on where bikes are available most often 25 population in service area the number of residents within the service area this figure can be estimated by summing the population of smaller geographic areas ie census tracts in the us dissemination areas in canada or 100m2 grids for countries in south america and asia within the bikeshare service area for geographic areas that are only partially within the service area the percentage of the geographic area that falls within the buffer is multiplied by that areas population and added to the total sum at its most basic level a bikeshare system is comprised of a certain number of bikes and in many cases stations and docks that will serve a given market these basic data

critical to cultivating high ridership the service area should be grounded in dense mixeduse areas with high tripgeneration capacity serving as both the origin and destination points of many trips these areasgenerally city centersare likely to see the most demand for bikeshare however the service area should also extend to lowerdensity areas where connectivity to the transportation system may be lacking for stationbased systems the service area must be large enough to contain a significant set of users origin and destination points if it is too small to provide meaningful connections between places the system will have a lower chance of success because its convenience will be compromised when defining the service area the city will have to balance demand with costs surveying and statistical data analysis will help to identify the appropriate service area and should be completed by a qualified planning organization if the city does not have in house expertisethe service area must be determined in tandem with the systems size to ensure the level of convenience reliability and ubiquity necessary for high ridership for dockless and hybrid systems the service area is typically the jurisdictional boundary of the city and has less of an impact on overall system usability than is the case for station based systems multijurisdictional dockless systems could reduce administration costs to implement and oversee a permit process and provide a larger service area for users regardless the city and bikeshare operators should clearly communicate to users locations that fall outside the systems limits but are inside the city boundary eg dockless bikes are not permitted to be parked on the national mall and other federally owned land in washington dc establishing

a convenient walking distance of both the origin and destination of their trip a large area of dense stations creates a network that users can learn to count on for all their trips in the city the

this parameter scales the number of bicycles to the number of potential users in the service area to ensure that there are enough bicycles to meet demand based on itdps analysis of bikeshare system metrics large dense cities or areas with high numbers of commuters andor tourists will likely require 10 to 30 bikes per 1000 residents to meet demand cities that have a large influx of commuters during the day will need a higher ratio of bikestoresidents to serve that augmented population this ratio should be large enough to meet demand but not so large as to have fewer than four daily uses

moderate ratios in relatively smaller cities like tianjin 23 bikes per 1000 residents which is just slightly higher than mexico citys 19 per 1000 residents this metric serves as a planning guideline to estimate the total number of bikes needed for a system which can then be used for cost estimate purposes for dockless systems this metric can help cities establish a cap on the total number of

financial planning estimates after decisions on system size and type are made an initial financial analysis can be undertaken this analysis asks whether the system will be financially sustainable and usually considers the estimated capital outlay projected revenue and operational costs it should also consider the advantages and disadvantages of different financing mechanisms the following recommendations assume that some financial cost and revenue will fall to the city however many private dockless bikeshare operators are able to provide bikeshare services without public funds indirect costs to the city to oversee monitor and enforce regulations on dockless bikeshare are likely the city will also not receive a portion of revenues from a fully private system but may receive some funds from dockless bikeshare operators in the form of permit application noncompliance andor in lieu fees it is recommended that cities pursuing a system operated by one or more private companies require those companies to demonstrate their longterm financial sustainability as part of a permit application or mou process see section 42 planning regulating dockless systems for more details about permit requirements for stationbased systems an estimation of capital costs and operating costs can be calculated by multiplying the number of bikes docks and stations against an average cost for each type of asset capital and operating costs are a function of system technology and are straightforward to determine but revenue depends on usage levels and can only be fully estimated in the infrastructure planning stage usually the revenue scenarios are based on expectations of demand using both a conservative estimate in which demand and therefore revenue is low and an optimistic scenario in which demand projections are higher resulting in higher projected revenue capital operating costs per bike useful to estimate costs during system planning capital costs are often expressed in terms of the cost per bike defined as the total cost of the systemincluding stations bikes rebalancing equipment the control center and other equipmentdivided by the total number of bikes in the system operating costs vary widely from system to system and from city to city operating costs are commonly expressed annually per bike and can vary based on rebalancing mechanisms and needs

analyze system performance after launch the costperbike estimate may be useful in the planning stage to size the system financially but to analyze system performance after the system launches a perbike analysis is not recommended because bike fleet size varies from day to day some have used the perdock metric for analyzing annual operating costs as a more stable and therefore more comparable basis27 however this guide recommends evaluating the cost efficiency of a system after it opens by looking at operating costs per trip for example washington dc and denver have similar operating costs per trip us255 and us324 respectively while operating costs per bike are very different us3445 and us1560 respectively washington dc has slightly lower 34 bikeshare economic performance more dense

estimating revenue uptake rate used to estimate demand for the system to estimate revenue multiply the demand estimations for usage against the proposed revenue structure demand is often estimated using an uptake rate which is an assumption of the percentage of people who will use the system compared to the total population within the service area commonly used uptake rate estimates include a conservative 3 uptake rate a middle estimate using a 6 uptake rate and an optimistic scenario of 9 washington dcs capital bikeshare has an uptake rate of about 5 mexico citys ecobici is close to 10 which may be explained by the heavy commuter population that enters the service area and uses ecobici but does not live within that area farebox recovery used to evaluate a systems financial health

system is selfsustaining most publicly funded stationbased systems do not meet their operating costs through membership and user fees alone although some do come close this is also the case for most public transit systems farebox recovery can be used to determine the degree to which other revenue sources such as advertising revenue government subsidies and system sponsorship will be needed to cover operating costs trips by type of user a financial analysis of a bikeshare system should consider what percentage of total trips will be taken by longterm members and what percentage by casual members in most systems casual users are charged a significantly higher price per trip or per day than annual users making casual users the source of more revenue per trip even if in numbers they are not the largest user group casual users are often less familiar with the bikeshare system and are therefore more likely to accrue fees for exceeding time limits while the system benefits from overtime charges customers who inadvertently accrue fees will likely be unhappy and may not use the system again typically as a system grows the percentage of casual users declines as some casual users purchase annual memberships estimating costs for privately funded bikeshare systems capital costs to the city are nominal inkind costs howeverwhich could include staff time to oversee the permit application review process attend public meetings on behalf of the city enforce permit requirements remove or repark bikes etcare likely some of these costs can be offset if the city decides to charge fees to bikeshare operators as detailed below it is worth noting that privatelyfunded dockless bikeshare may be more economically scalable compared to stationbased systems because of the vastly lower capital costs required some dockless bikes only cost about us200 each and the most expensive dockless bikes on the market jumps smart pedal assist ebikes cost us1500 each compared to approximately us5500 which includes bike and station costs for stationbased systems like citi bike and vlib lower capital and operating costs could enable dockless systems to offer coverage to more parts of the city especially in previously underserved or lowerincome neighborhoods estimating revenue without public investment in bikeshare operations the city will not receive revenue from traditional streams such as sponsorship or advertising instead limited revenue may be generated from one or more of the following fees it is highly recommended that to avoid corruption or improper regulation bikeshare staff tasked with assessing fines are not compensated with and do not directly benefit from revenue generated from those fines 332 financial planning for privately funded systems 36 annual permit fee this fee is paid by the operator to the city as part of the permit application package and will typically be paid subsequently on an annual basis as part of the permit renewal process this may also be

industrial areas may require fewer because of land use and existing conditions however reliable coverage through uniform station density or at least a minimum station density is critical to creating a system that users can truly rely on for travel within and around the service area alternatively the city is less involved in infrastructure planning for a dockless bikeshare system because private operators have already made decisions around the types of bike they offer and where to deploy and rebalance bikes based on demand station design is less necessary relative to a stationbased bikeshare system although the city should at this time consider whether to create dockless bikeshare parking zones and what those might look like for example will bike racks be installed in parking zones to accommodate personal and lock to bikes andor install additional racks to increase overall bike parking it should also consider whether to mandate that operators encourage usersperhaps through reduced fare incentivesto park there implementing this type of parking system at the outset may help to avoid user confusion and establish habits for users to utilize the designated parking zones despite the system type knowledge of existing trip patterns can help determine demand for bikeshare most cities use local knowledge to estimate demand and how it might vary throughout the day and across days to get an idea of popular destinations in the area origin destination od surveys can be conducted at major public transport terminals and stations focusing on passengers who transfer to rideshare taxis or buses to complete their journey this can help to determine where the system is most likely to succeed and to anticipate demand however this type of survey will not capture potential users who are not currently well served by transit so complementary outreach to the public should be conducted to assess demand from those populations strategically located bikeshare stations can contribute to

fewer activities to attract a variety of users furthermore underused areas like underpasses while interesting in terms of activating underutilized space should be carefully considered for potential

charging only stations designed to operate as charging locations for pedal assist ebikes often require a connection to the electrical grid to charge this may require consultation with the electrical utility 41 the idea is to have a roughly even distribution of stations while working within the constraints of the environment creating a first draft of station locations can be done in one of two ways grid approach stations are mapped out remotely using a grid to ensure even coverage and then verified with site visits to map locations remotely draw a grid of 1by1kilometer squares over a base map of the service area using either a computer program google maps gis etc or a paper map marker and ruler the grid provides a simple foundation for evenly distributed stations the base map should show transit stations and bicycle lanes as well as any other important demand generators or facilities then applying the station density parameter and station location guidelines calculate the number of locations per grid square this ensures that stations are spaced evenly throughout the service area for example if the desired station density is 14 stations per square kilometer 14 stations should be placed more or less evenly in each grid square the grid can be subdivided into high stationdensity and low stationdensity zones if desired though a uniformly highdensity approach is recommended for most areas field approach station locations are identified in the field and then analyzed remotely and adjusted where there is too much or too little coverage if the planning team starts in the field it will need to ensure continuous coverage by drawing buffers around each proposed station using a diameter of 300 500 meters the areas left without coverage will then need to be analyzed to see if a station should be added and if so where while the goal is to use the station density parameter to ensure uniform coverage this is rarely achieved across the board because existing infrastructure and land uses often dictate how many and what size stations are needed station locations identified through either the grid or field approach detailed above should be vetted by a team of stakeholders that includes residents local business owners operators city officials etc to ensure that all considerations are being addressed engaging stakeholders in the station location processespecially early enough to actually integrate feedback into the final decision makingis a good way to build support and community buyin for the project as part of their initial planning both new york city and washington dc

permanent stations may be preferred for systems with pedal assist ebikes so that bikes can be charged while they are checked into a station in automated stations there are two basic types of station design that accommodate checkin and checkout docking spaces and cycle parking areas a system may incorporate both station types depending on demand levels desired street views and availability of space at a particular station whether a system uses docks or parking areas stations should always have more docking positions or storage space than bikes to accommodate peak demand this should be reflected in the stations docksperbike ratio discussed in detail in subsection 322 determine station size docking spaces each space docks one bicycle the number of spaces determines the size of the stations footprint which means there is a great deal of flexibility to adjust the station size to fit the existing urban landscape this style takes up more space per bike than cycle parking areas but blends in better with the urban environment and is popular for roadside stations bicycles are checked out by customers either at the terminal or at the actual docking space docking spaces can be more userfriendly because a rider simply rolls the bike into and out of the docking space to lock or unlock it bike parking areas bicycles are stored together typically on racks in a secured area while less common than docking spaces bike parking areas can be a good option for larger stationsthat is more than 50 bicyclesbecause parking racks can hold more bikes per square meter than docking spaces bicycle parking areas are best utilized in underused spaces such as those beneath overpasses or in suburban areas where land space is less scarce than in the downtown core at stations with cycle parking areas bicycles are checked in and out through a turnstile or similar mechanism because these stations require a secure area that is fenced or walled off they can be more intrusive in the urban landscape additionally bike parking areas that require a bike be lifted onto the rack could pose barriers to lessable riders docking spaces can be arranged in a variety of styles in order to best match the stations surroundings in tight spaces more drastically angled docks allow for more bikes,"[101, 1999, 1996, 2149, 2224, 2122, 2512, 6113, 19160, 3703, 2065, 1037, 2276, 3295, 2003, 2179,

alternatively in more open spaces parallel docks help maximize station capacity source william murphy flickr cc 47 42 planning regulating dockless systems over the last several years a new approach to bikeshare has emerged dockless bikeshare while stationless bikeshare systems such as callabike and nextbike have existed for years in europe they relied heavily on government support were not reliant on smartphone technology and never achieved the levels of growth currently underway the rise of dockless bikeshare however comes as a direct response to some of the challenges that traditional stationbased bikeshare systems have faced both in terms of convenience for users and the need for public funding dockless bikeshare relies heavily if not exclusively on smartphone technology and high speed internet and operators typically charge very low fees on a per ride basis supported almost entirely by venture capital funding dockless bikeshare companies function without government subsidies enabling them to avoid the often lengthy government procurement processes associated with traditional singleoperator stationbased systems dockless bikeshare in its current form has operated in china since 2014 but was largely unregulated during its infancy in april 2017 chinese citiesinundated with millions of dockless bikes and the challenges that came with thembegan exploring options for regulating supply managing public space and ensuring user safety and privacy soon after in july 2017 seattle released the firstever comprehensive permit structure to manage dockless bikeshare operations before companies dropped bikes on city streets as other cities emulated this preemptive regulation strategy many realized that a delicate balance is required operators need flexibility to innovate compete and improve their service delivery technology and business models meanwhile parameters that limit oversupply of bikes ensure bike safety and protect users are critical by passing municipal ordinances designing pilot programs andor using other regulatory mechanisms to oversee how dockless bikeshare is deployed and managed citywide more and more cities are rightly demanding dockless operators coordinate with them prior to launching operations even though the city does not provide funds to directly support dockless bikeshare its operation depends on the use of cityowned streets sidewalks and other public infrastructure by establishing a permit system request for proposals rfp memorandum of understanding mou or similar regulatory mechanism cities are well positioned to dockless bikeshare became hugely popular in china shortly after it emerged on the scene and operators responded by flooding unprepared chinese cities with hundreds of thousands of bikes source itdp

here that dockless bikeshare and the current operating model is still new and rapidlyevolving this guide will not necessarily provide all the answers but does in the following sections offer a framework for cities to experiment with regulatory approaches while maintaining a strong focus on maximizing public benefits 421 integrate dockless bikeshare into city goals bikeshare can be a key component in achieving access economic development sustainability health and other goals cities are already working toward for example the greater manchester region of the uk is using dockless bikeshare to help meet existing climaterelated goals by increasing bike mode share to 10 of trips by 2025 and reducing vehicle kilometers traveled vkt and singleoccupancy vehicle trips singapore which is aiming to increase transit ridership to 75 of commuters by 2030 committed to investing in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure so that more people can comfortably access transit the citys regulated dockless bikeshare system offers an additional firstlastkilometer option to help meet that goal bikeshare can also contribute to economic development goals attracting both tourists and businesses as well as offer an affordable sustainable transportation mode for visitors to explore the city and a qualityoflife benefit for potential employees identifying how dockless bikeshare can connect with existing goals will help cities decide which policies to prioritize and how best to track progress and measure success policy framework for regulating dockless bikeshare improve planning enforcement foster equity accessibility effectively manage public space protect users 3 monitor operations access verify operator data 3 enforce policies hire goverment staff periodic evaluation framework realtime evaluation framework 2 establish operations level objectives 1 position bikeshare within city goals 4 evaluate policies 4 amend policies if necessary analyze operator data user feedback consider new technologies business models etc 49 in addition to contributing to citywide goals policies should address specific challenges related to dockless bikeshare including oversupply of bikes lack of coordination between governments and operators uncertainty around service delivery etc for the purposes of this guide these challenges are grouped into four operationslevel objectives that cities must achieve 1 effectively manage public space 2 foster equity and accessibility 3 improve planning and enforcement 4 protect users conditions and goals undoubtedly differ from city to city and uncertainty exists in relation to local authorities regulating dockless bikeshare given these realities a menu of policies is suggested that achieves each objective enabling cities to construct regulatory frameworks that meet their specific needs in addition it is important to recognize that goals and objectives may conflict with each other for example the operational objective to protect users through more rigorous equipment standards may lead to more expensive bikes and user fees making it more challenging to meet the citywide goal of providing affordable travel options dockless bikeshare operates under the assumption that public space will be available for bike parking between uses in some areas public space may be less contested because of wide sidewalks low pedestrian flows etc but in areas with narrow sidewalks high pedestrian traffic street trees or other planters outdoor restaurant seating and any number of other uses,"[101, 2182, 2008, 8946, 3238,

of public space parked bikeshare bikes compete for space it is up to the city to allocate public space for dockless bike parking to avoid negative outcomes such as bike piles and bikes blocking the pedestrian rightofway chinese cities have had to shoulder the enormous cost of removing thousands of bikes because of parking andor public space violations cities have a number of policies at their disposal to ensure more clearly defined parking habits and orderly public spaces however capacity andor resource constraints may limit what a city can require and enforce local authorities will also need to consider tradeoffsdesignating space for dockless bikes will likely mean less space for pedestrians if bikes are parked on the sidewalk or cars if street parking is converted to bike parking areas fleet size cap the number of bikes operators can have on the street is limited without a cap operators could flood cities with large quantities of bikes to capture market share however if the fleet cap is set too low the system will never achieve reliability because it will be too difficult to find a bike a balance needs to be struck between providing bikeshare service and overcrowding public space with infrequently used bikes fleet size caps could be designed to increase over timefor example by a percentage each month for the first three months of operation as is the case in seattleor remain static as in milan which restricts each operator to a maximum of 3000 bikes cities should also consider periodic adjustments to caps based on performance and ridership data ie trips per bike per day see subsection 423 monitoring and enforcing policies for more timebound response to parking complaints operators are required to respond to complaints about misparked bikes within a certain time frame typically two hours the city then has the authority to fine the operator or remove the bike from the street at the operators expense user education operators must include information on both proper and inappropriate parking locations on their website and on their mobile app which users must read through and agree to follow to complete the registration process cities

addition since lockto bikes cannot be easily relocated cities should consider how to deal with improperly locked bikes such as those parked on private property where the city may lack jurisdiction to intervene dockless bike parking areas physical parking areas are sited and installed by the city for use by all dockless bikes bike racks should be installed so that lockto dockless bikes and personal bikes can utilize the parking area parking areas may be particularly beneficial in more congested areas where competition for sidewalk space is high city staff will need to work with operators to ensure that a the gps technology on their bikes is accurate enough to recognize bikes parked within the designated areas as complying and b parking areas are clearly defined and users are incentivized to use them across all realtime service maps parking area costs can be offset through operator fees refer to section 411 for guidance on station siting one of the strengths of dockless bikeshare is that it brings fleets of shared bikes into cities increasing visibility for cycling and creating immediate potential for more trips to be made by bike access to transit jobs and other destinations could drastically improveespecially in historically disconnected communitiesif dockless bikes are consistently available this will only happen if cities are mindful of the barriers to using bikeshare that can be present in low income communities and demand that operators meet one or more of the following accessibility requirements additionally cities should develop a comprehensive community outreach strategy for communicating the benefits of bikeshare and encouraging cycling as a costeffective sustainable transportation option bike distribution requirement an operator can only have a certain number of bikes cap in each zone could be neighborhoods wards etc or must provide a minimum service level informed by the rate of usage in communities identified as being underserved this could help to ensure that spatial distribution of bikes across the city is more equitable and that bikes can be more reliably found in less dense or less destinationheavy zones while making sure that bikes are not oversaturating lowdemand areas flexible and reduced payment options accessibility to dockless bikeshare can be limited by the need for a smartphone to locate and unlock a bike and a credit card linked to a users account cities could require operators to provide at least one alternative payment option for users to top up their account cash at local stores using a prepaid card etc to ensure bikeshare is affordable san francisco requires dockless operators to provide a reducedfare plan to lowincome customers that waives the initial deposit and offers unlimited trips less than 30

maintenance issues involving their bikes as standard practice proof of liability insurance should also be required prior to commencing operation user deposit refund protections while many operators seem to be moving away from requiring user deposits at least in certain markets several still require a deposit upon registering cities should consider establishing a government or escrow account to

periodically evaluated by the city or a thirdparty managed by the city to ensure that dockless bikeshare policies are effectively meeting established goals appropriate data that corresponds to progress toward each goal should be collected for this purpose for example to measure equity of the system an annual comprehensive survey that each operator distributes to users could help the city understand the demographics and needs of system users these data could then be combined with data collected by other means such as modal split accessibility and other existing indicators to develop a more complete travel picture from this evaluation policies such as fleet size caps service area restrictions equipment standards etc can be analyzed and adjusted as needed periodic evaluation may also shed light on the need for secondary or followup policies to bolster the effects of existing policies such as adding physically marked dockless bike parking areas if operators are falling short on public space management requirements it is important however to make this process as clear as possible to operators which may be very sensitive to any significant changes in policy this longerterm evaluation process should also include a review of technological business model andor other significant changes that have emerged and how these might impact existing policies funding for this periodic

over time include geographic information system gis skills an understanding of apis and how to field verify operator data because this data will help to inform compliance checks the position should be housed within or have a direct link to the department tasked with issuing fines to enforce dockless bikeshare policies it is not recommended however that this staff member be directly or solely responsible for issuing fines thus avoiding the potential for bribery by operators or other corrupt practices optimally an additional staff member would be responsible for community outreach and education to encourage the uptake of bikeshare citywide and to help establish norms of behavior cities might consider establishing a staff to bike ratio ie one staff member per 1000 bikes that would enable scaling up staff capacity as bikeshare expands compensation for dockless bikeshare monitoring staff may be funded through permit andor administrative fees paid by the private companies to operate on the public rightsofway channels should be put in place to reduce the ability of bikeshare staff to approve many companies to operate to collect administrative fees additionally given the potential for conflict of interest funding for monitoring staff should not come from noncompliance fines imposed on companies to ensure policies are successfully minimizing operationslevel challenges cities should as a prerequisite for operation require operators to provide realtime data that is easy to validate verified operator data is critical for an accurate analysis of system performance and for carrying out effective enforcement performance analysis will quantify the impact the policies are having in relation to each operations objective and help track progress toward city goals based on this progress dockless bikeshare policies can be adjustedfor example re evaluating fleet maximumsto ensure that goals and operations objectives continue to be met even as technologies business models andor other changes arise for more detail see subsection 424 below consistent reliable data submitted by operators in a standardized format enables the city to be flexible and responsive to how these changes affect the bikeshare operating environment and to rework policies to stay on track to meet city goals a policy enforcement strategy should be implemented from the outset to establish norms that maximize policy compliance and minimize the need for future enforcement a successful strategy will require 1 reliable realtime and historical data from operators and 2 government staff capable of interpreting that data and assessing penalties when appropriate it is recommended that cities enforce policies through fines or other penalties levied on operators for non compliance as necessary these fines may be passed on to users to establish user norms in addition to operator norms revenue generated from fines could be directed to bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure projects but should not be used to compensate city bikeshare staff thereby avoiding any appearance of conflict of interest specific enforcement approaches are discussed in subsection 642 permit enforcement mechanisms 53

viewed by some as increasing competition for public space on the sidewalk green space and parking space cities can curb these sentiments by developing streetscapes that maximize space and usability for sustainable modescomplete streetsand using bikeshare as a catalyst to improve accessibility complete streets have been shown to both encourage cycling and decrease fatal crashes31 while bikeshare can be implemented even if there is little existing cycling infrastructure pairing the construction of new bike lanes with the opening of a bikeshare system can add to public acceptance and improve safety for users of the new system as well as personal bike riders when seville spain launched its sevici bikeshare system in 2007 the city committed to building hundreds of kilometers of cycle tracks over the next decade a wellconnected network of lanes emerged and seville saw a marked increase in bike trips and a decrease in crashes and bike related injuries in city after city building bike lanes has been shown to increase bike ridership and when integrated with bikeshare can make a compelling case for additional infrastructure investments that will continue to increase the number of bikes on the road32 conversely a large uptick in the number of cyclists on the road because of bikeshare can be a visible reminder of the need for safe separated bike lanes the mayor of chengdu in china committed to building 600 kilometers of bike lanes following the massive increase of bike riders brought about by dockless bikeshare in that city the number of daily trips on mobikes alone have eclipsed the number of daily subway trips33 additionally data generated from bikeshare trips can provide evidence of the impact of bicycle network improvements whereas it can be difficult to gather this data from private bike users this evidence showing that bike infrastructure is being usedand perhaps generating more bike trips and thus more data could even help make the case for more

onesizefitsall a bikeshare system usually offers one size and style of bike the bicycle should be comfortable for most users and should allow for adjustments to the seat height but no ability to remove the seat but since there is only one size it will not be adequate for every single user the city should estimate the average user height and make a recommendation based on that a step through frame with long seat post can easily accommodate a wide variety of heights and is easier to mount for riders wearing skirts or dresses robust a bikeshare bike has a much higher frequency of use than personal bikes as discussed in subsection 311 four to eight trips per bike per day is typical bikeshare bikes should have an average lifespan of three to five years bikes built to operate for a year or two indicate that the operator has minimized capital investment to deploy more bikes and capture market share and may incentivize complete replacement of broken bikes instead of maintaining and repairing them lowmaintenance bicycles designed to require less maintenance ie selfpowered led lights nonpuncture airless tires etc typically have lower operating costs and may enable more bikes to stay in service at a time however lowmaintenance bikes could provide a lowerquality ride so a balance should be struck between ride quality and maintenance needs secure to deter theft the bikes in stationbased systems must securely and easily lock into the docking space and dockless bikes should be equipped with a sturdy wheel lock or builtin lock that attaches them to street furniture although

including limebike have given away free helmets as promotional items and to encourage bikeshare riders to comply with the county regulation in australia low ridership numbers for melbourne and brisbanes bikeshare programs have been partially attributed to those cities helmet laws which like in seattle were kept in place despite the launch of bikeshare there is little evidence that mandatory helmet laws actually reduce injury rates for cyclists and prominent cycling advocacy groups in the united states such as the washington area bicyclist association waba and people for bikes oppose these types of laws because the negative consequencesreducing ridershipoutweigh the benefits 38 therefore we recommend eliminating helmet laws but encouraging helmet use through education and

the station kiosk some dockless operators offer alternatives to using a smartphone to find and unlock their bikes in addition to an rfid card reader jump pedal assist bikes include a small keypad onto which a code can be entered to unlock and use the bike this technology is more expensive to install and maintain than the typical qr code unlocking mechanism and is not offered across all dockless

poses a challenge since bikes can be locked up virtually anywhere within the city boundaries some dockless operators make use of geofencing to encourage users to lock their bikes inside hubs where

access to more users common elements of these programs include heavily reduced memberships typically under us10 for one year a cash payment option qualification tied to receiving other government benefits andor extended ride times efforts should be made to publicize reducedfare memberships especially in neighborhoods with high populations of lowincome residents in addition to establishing reduced annual membership programs cities should also consider more flexible payment options for fullpriced memberships a monthly payment option can help make the cost of a membership more palatable

system immediately places a us100 hold on the users credit card which can remain for up to 10 days after returning a bike this can be problematic for debit card users too who may be charged overdraft fees if the full amount of the hold is not available in the account in a survey conducted by portland state university about equity in cycling and bikeshare 69 of low income respondents identified the potential for being charged for damages to a bikeshare bike as a significant barrier to trying the system40 cities should weigh the benefits of depositsnamely fostering a sense of ownership over shared bikesagainst the barriers they pose to lowincome riders not requiring a deposit could result in greater instances of theft or vandalism of bikes thereby reducing the number of bikes available and challenging an operators profit margin and longterm financial viability still several systems have begun to shy away from charging users an upfront deposit many dockless operators in particular are eliminating user deposit requirements in certain markets to stay competitive with each other although it charges users a deposit in other european cities dockless operator obike chose not to require a deposit when it launched in oxford uk since ofo and mobike were already operating there without charging deposits41 additionally concerns have arisen in china and elsewhere about the lack of transparency around how dockless bikeshare companies are using user deposits and the unwillingness or inability of several companies to refund to users after ceasing operations age minimums while many

connections to a variety of destination types source itdp 67 system operations in the past many bikeshare system operations were defined by asset ownership and revenue flow between the city government and the operator the goal was to balance service provision with resource allocation this is still the case for many stationbased systems however the business model of private dockless bikeshare companies presents a shift in how city governments approach bikeshare operations as part of the larger public transport system bikeshare should be organized similarly to other public transportation systems despite the system type the government agency responsible for overseeing bikeshare will need to identify or hire staff members responsible for managing system implementation for public systems this includes design tendering and contracting outreach and launching the system for single or multioperator private systems city staff will be responsible for overseeing the mou or permitting process monitoring and enforcement and engaging with operators a bikeshare system can be completely public completely private or some combination of the two bikeshare can also be operated by a single operator or multiple operators the decision regarding which aspects should be public or private and how many operators are appropriate depends on the environment in which the system operates different cities will require different structures to meet their specific needs and this should be informed by the feasibility analysis 61 organizational structure the organizational structure establishes the

entity will be located within the agency that has the authority to build out the stationsthat is the authority that has control over the roadbeds and sidewalks as the system grows across political boundaries and integrates with other transport systems however this structure could hinder expansion in some cases for example in indian cities kochi and chennai a specialpurpose vehicle spv for metro rail implemented bikeshare stations at metro stops spvs can also be incorporated at the city or state level to implement a bikeshare system facilitating interdepartmental coordination it may be helpful to consider what a system might look like in five or ten years and place the agency accordingly this will streamline decision making growth and general administrative processes outside of the transport department other departments that can house the implementing agency include the departments of urban development environment and parks and recreation as well as public transport agencies and

the agency will need to develop a strategy for carrying out compliance checks and communicating noncompliance with operators annually or at another regular interval established in the contract or permit the implementing agency should reevaluate performance requirements and make any necessary changes despite the bikeshare system type the implementing agency plays the role of referee keeping the best interests of the city and customers in mind while also considering the financial interest of the operator to avoid conflicts of interest the agency should be fully independent of the contractor

operated by private bikeshare companies under a permit or mou process can result in a multioperator environment that generates competition and hopefully a higher level of service that attracts users and maximizes revenues single operator the first decision when selecting an operator is determining whether the operator will be part of the government such as the implementing agency or an external operator such as a forprofit or nonprofit entity a parastatal agency or quasigovernmental operator such as a transit agency that is close to the implementing agency brings with it access to the government and the benefits of a cooperative relationship the drawback to such a situation is that public operators typically lack the incentives to expand and grow the bikeshare system tending to focus exclusively on daytoday operations private operators however generally bring more cost efficiency but their primary objective is profitability and that does not always align with providing a useful bikeshare system when working with a private operator a wellwritten contract and oversight are essential to ensure that the operator meets its obligations to the implementing agency sometimes governments prefer turnkey projects in which the private operator can set up the whole project by itself in one large contract providing both the assets and the operation other times the government prefers to separate the contracts for the operations and for hardware and software procurement this mitigates the risk involved with having just one company that the government is wholly dependent upon but it increases the risk of the different pieces not working well together the city should also consider the benefits and challenges of offering exclusivity to a single operator for example a city may offer an exclusive franchise to an operator in return for higher levels of service or guarantees of multiyear continuity of service pricing caps or more equitable service the operator will likely be attracted by exclusivity because of the potential for additional revenue perhaps through naming rights or other benefits the downsides of offering exclusivity are that new technologies may take longer to be implemented enforcement keeping other operators out is complex andor that consumers have less choice in the market while not as common some singleoperator bikeshare systems are operated by one dockless operator as opposed to providing stationbased service under an mou or contract this is the case in manchester uk where the regional transport agency entered into an mou with dockless operator mobike to provide bikeshare service as part of a sixmonth smart city demonstrator 71 financing coordination with city service delivery weaknesses single operator ppp barcelona london

determines the quality of the system if a city government cannot or does not want to make a significant capital outlay it often means ceding control over the quality lifespan of the bikes to their owner in this case the city should set strict permit requirements that ensure a baseline asset and service quality decisions about asset ownership and about who should make the initial investment should be guided by the lifetime of the asset as that typically guides the contracting period for bikeshare systems the average lifespan of a bike is three to five years while stations typically last

smaller budget packages that may be financed separately the latter was the case in bandung which leveraged full city funding for procurement and a revenuesharing agreement for operations furthermore separate contracts help mitigate the risk that may come with relying on a single entity and enable the government to contract with an entity that specializes in the requested service for instance if a smartcard system and payment mechanism are integrated into the citys larger public transport system that operator could be contracted to expand into bikeshare and be responsible for payment and customer tracking while another entity would be contracted for operations the duration of the contracts that require investment into infrastructure are usually tied to the lifespan of that infrastructure to allow for depreciation of the asset and a chance to obtain a return on the investment before having to invest in recapitalization in london the contract for the santander cycles bikeshare system runs for five years with the potential for an additional fiveyear extension paris contract with smovengo to operate the new vlib metropole system began in 2018 and runs through 203245 while long contracts like these tend to be attractive to operators because they reduce risk they can also stifle innovation shorter contracts such as those that coincide with the three to five year lifespan of a highquality bikeshare bicycle give more flexibility to the implementing agency and offer greater opportunities to adapt the system to emerging technologies and operating models since the station and it infrastructure are expected to last beyond the initial operations contract the implementing agency should ensure that all the pieces of the bikeshare system work together especially the software bikes and stations in the case of software usage rights and the data should be retained by the city after the operating contract is over it is worth nothing that while ppp arrangements have been widely used to implement station based systems cities may enter into an exclusive agreement with a dockless operator this is the case in manchester which established an mou with mobike to provide dockless bikeshare service in the city the regional transportation agency transport for greater manchester chairs an operations group that consists of members from mobike and the city councils of manchester and nearby salford to discuss topics related to rebalancing parking and data sharing privatelyoperated nonppp systems because private bikeshare companies operate within the public realm they should be required to apply for a municipal permit to operate similar to businesses or restaurants that place merchandise or outdoor seating on the sidewalk in addition to the permit itself several cities including seattle san francisco charlotte oxford and dublin require private bikeshare operators to agree to abide by additional rules to be approved to operate see section 42 planning

the ownership of assets and provision of service publicly owned and operated 631 the government owns the assets and provides the services publicly owned and privately operated 632 the government owns

government regulation 74 under this type of contracting structure the government plans designs implements and operates the bikeshare system the government also owns all the assets of the system and the financial risk lies entirely with the city the implementing agency would then most likely become the operator or operations could be contracted out to a parastatal or another government agency the greatest advantage to this structure is that one entity is responsible for the planning procurement implementation operations and future expansion of the system additionally the public authority is able to prioritize the desired goals of the systemideally that it supports the larger public transportation systemover other incentives such as profitability the downsides to this type of business model include the need for and risks associated with public funding as well as disincentives to improve service because of a lack of competition and innovation typically generated by the private

this model it is owned by the city which allocated us2 million in federal funding to cover the systems startup costs public funding however ends there since the system is operated by a private bikeshare company the citys contract with the operator includes few specific requirements for rebalancing or maintaining certain capacities at each station this flexibility is designed to encourage the operator to run bikeshare like a businessas efficiently and costeffectively as possibleand this notion is further incentivized through a requirement that the operator cover any financial losses the system generates in its first three years of operation however the company will receive 60 of any program surplus with the rest going back to the city the advantage of this model is that the

phases of the project while not assuming financial responsibility for day today operating details or system risk in some cases shorter contracts can be negotiated if the operator has no investment in the infrastructure this offers more flexibility for the city but also requires more staff time for planning issuing tenders negotiating signing a contract every year 632 publicly owned and privately operated under this type of contracting structure one or more private entities own the assets and provide the service while the government grants access to public space and the rightsofway in privately owned and operated system arrangements the city should be sure to set clear standards for the system that are communicated through a tender permit or code of conduct ultimately the government grants the rights in the form of legislation and street space to operate but the capital assets are owned and the operational costs are borne by the private operators this approach avoids the need for cities to budget public funds to bikeshare and in some cases cities can actually generate revenue by requiring operators to pay a fee to apply for a permit privately owned and operated systems do have some risks associated with them particularly regarding conflicts of interest and balancing the citys goals for widespread distribution against the private operators desire to optimize revenue normally the private operator is interested in the most dense highrevenueproducing areas or neighborhoods while the city may have a greater interest in making sure the system is equitable across the city covering areas that may produce relatively low revenue in the operational agreement the city should be sure to include safeguards to ensure assets are maintained by operators in lowdensity lowincome communities of concern either through establishing geofenced hubs or fleet minimums in these areas or through inlieu fees these approaches are explained in detail in subsection

least one fulltime staff person either within the city government structure or a consultant is responsible for overseeing bikeshare enforcement additional details on staffing are included in subsection 721 service levels ensure a baseline of quality in system operations hardware and software customer service maintenance redistribution marketing and reporting each service level normally identifies an optimal level and then a variance within which performance is acceptable the operator is then penalized if varying from the service level negatively affects the system and rewarded if it positively affects the system offering rewards as well as penalties enables flexibility in how an operator can make revenue from the system for example an operator of a recently launched system is having a hard time keeping the system online in accordance with the software service level agreement because of initial glitches in the system this causes the operator to fail to meet the service level in this category the operator does however far exceed the service level for membership between the service level for software which the operator does not meet and for membership which it exceeds the operator is able to secure a decent revenue while working on the service levels where there are problems service levels should be designed to create incentives for an operator to increase its revenue while doing an outstanding job they should not bankrupt the company while the government sets the quality and service standards when the contract is signed it should work with the private sector on the best way to achieve the desired service level it is important to look at the capabilities and limitations of the system and set the service levels realistically when planning a system many service levels will be estimates or best guesses and will likely need to be reevaluated using performance data from the initial year of operation identifying what data to collect from the outset to assess performance will help to inform and adjust service levels service levels that prove to be unreasonably high should be lowered to be more realistic while those that are being vastly exceeded should be adjusted or should include ceilings regarding compensation service levels should act as an evolving matrix of giveandtake between the operator and the authority or governing body there are two basic principles regarding monitoring service levels easy costeffective realistic service levels should be monitored at little expense to the city government setting service levels that cannot be monitored easily leads to difficulty calculating the compensation to the operator and can result in nonenforcement this ambiguity starts off small but will over time create problems in the relationship between the operator and the city transparent the authority should have access to all data collected and transmitted by the system and should know how much revenue comes from the different sources audited financials should be shared by the operator with the city so there is a clear picture of excessive profit or loss the contractual relationship between the operator and the governing body with the associated service levels creates the performancemanagement system the performance management,"[101, 2560, 2028, 2440, 7292, 3095, 2711, 2593, 2306, 1996, 2103, 2231, 3252,

system is usually based on a weighted points system whereby service levels that are very important like the systems being online are weighted more heavily than those that are desirable but not essential such as marketing efforts by weighting the service levels the governing body can create an incentive to the operator to put resources toward meeting service levels that the governing body feels are most important to serve the user 641 managing contracts through service levels 76 similar to service levels permits enable cities to establish systemwide standards that operators must meet continue operating having mechanisms in place to enforce these requirements is critical to achieving optimal service quality this can be done in a variety of ways noncompliance fees if an operator violates operational permit requirements such as not removing broken bikes from the street or rebalancing bikes that have not been ridden in the time frame expressed in the permit they may be required to pay a noncompliance fee if possible the city may want to divert these fees into a fund used to support bike parking infrastructure or providing reduced cost rides to lowincome residents assessing compliance falls to city staff and it is unlikely they will have the capacity to monitor every operators fleet at all hours of the day however city bikeshare staff should fieldverify operator data on realtime bike locations and take test trips that can be identified in submitted trip history data once staff has verified an operators data they should begin checking for operational compliance both on the ground conducting sweeps of the city and using real time data from operators permit language should reflect that if a certain percentage of any operators fleet is not meeting the requirements when city staff completes a sweep they may be subject to a noncompliance fee relocating bikes many permits give the city authority to relocate or remove bikes from the street that do not comply with permit requirements such as those that have been reported as broken but have not been maintenanced within the permit time frame or those that are blocking the public right of way seattles permit requires operators to pay a fee equal to 115 of the city staff members hourly rate for the city having to relocate or remove noncompliant bicycles permit freeze revocation if an operator fails to meet major permit requirements like not providing safety information to users or exceeding fleet maximums set by the city a temporary freeze may be initiated on the operators permit as an intermediate step while the operator makes adjustments necessary to comply with the permit failure to do so within a certain time frame will lead to revocation of the operators permit in indonesia governments have undertaken this strategy in cases of serious noncompliance permit freezes and revocations should only be initiated in extreme circumstances since reducing the availability of bikes would be counterproductive to most citywide mobility goals 642 permit enforcement mechanisms 65 data requirements and management contracts and permits with bikeshare operators should require them to share

to expand accessibility and efficiency of the bikeshare system and efforts should be made to make anonymized data publicly available for broader analysis twoway data sharing between city transportation departments and mobility providers will also be key toward eventually achieving mobility as a service maas at the very least cities should require realtime data for every bike in

used during the morning rush hour while a bikeshare system may operate 24 hours a day most trips occur between 700 am and 900 pm during those periods rebalancing may be necessary especially for stations that experience high peakdemand for example most systems have found that stations at the tops of hills are often empty as people will check out a bike and ride down the hill but will rarely ride up the hill to park at that station a similar phenomenon occurs with dockless bikes gathering at the bottom of hills many systems however try to do most of the rebalancing at night when less traffic makes moving around the city more efficient regardless a system for rebalancing bikes to the locations of greatest use is essential taking into consideration initial data and modeling and expectations of ridership the operator should not expect to rebalance the system perfectly from the start but rather should make the best plan according to generated trip data and refine that plan after the system is implemented as well as following any significant expansions targets for rebalancing and bike and dock availability should be included in contract service levels mous or permit

be spelled out in the servicelevel agreements in the contract between the implementing agency and the operator or in the permit requirements for operatorsgenerally the implementing agency will ask the operators to develop or meet a maintenance and repair protocol that ensures that users only experience bikes in top form no matter where they begin their trip for example the contract or permit language should stipulate how long a broken bicycle may be left at a station or on the street how long a terminal or docking space can be out of commission before the operator faces a penalty for stationbased systems or how long a bike can be parked without being ridden ie due to malfunction or low demand before the operator has to relocate it for dockless systems contracts or permits should also require the operators to provide data on maintenance requests and actual repairs for broken bicycles six to twelve hours is usually an appropriate time frame to expect the operator to address the

consulted some operators estimate a 10 annual theft rate and integrate the costs of replacement bikes into their financial models in some systems deposits or liability holds are placed on a users

to take true ownership of and pride in the system framing bikeshare as an extension of transit that is available to and used by residents and visitors alike reduces the notion that the system is primarily designed for certain privileged groups many private dockless companies including mobike obike and ofo disincentivize destructive user behavior through a scoring system linked to each users account users are rewarded for good behavior like parking a bike correctly and consistent use violations such as incorrectly parking a bike using a private lock taking a bike into a residence or office and theft reduce a users score and falling below a certain threshold substantially increases the users price per trip from us1 to us20 per trip for mobike users until the users score improves serious vandalism such as damage or graffiti can often be difficult to attribute to a specific user so this type of penalization strategy likely would not deter such activity cities in which graffitti is widespread should expect that bikeshare assets will not be immune thus cities should have a plan in place to deal with vandalism as soon as possible or have clear permit requirements for operators to act within a certain time frame to address vandalised or damaged bikes in addition private operators should be motivated to protect their brand and will likely benefit from addressing these issues as soon as possible 726 insurance antitheft accidents vandalism 73 revenue streams the final component of creating the financial model is determining the revenue streams namely defining membership fees and user pricing most publicly funded systems require some combination of advertising sponsorship membership fees and tax revenues to cover their operating costs in this case the general recommendation is that operators be paid by the government based on servicelevel agreements and not directly from revenue streams as it helps with transparency of the system and gives the government some control over performance private operators providing bikeshare outside of a publicprivate partnership ie permit program mou etc cover their operating costs through trip fares user deposits and investment funding from venture capital and other private firms the longterm profitability of this approach has yet to be proven for publicly funded systems the utility bikeshare provides is often more important than its revenue potential government funding for capital costs and operations makes sense in light of the fact that bikeshare is part of the larger public transport network in europe the us and many other cities in the developed world public transport is generally subsidized what the city invests the city has a chance to receive a return on but for private operators running bikeshare as a business their revenues are typically theirs to keep the financial model for a publiclyfunded system however must be clear on where any revenue generated through the system will go and this must be defined in the contract in chicago revenue generated from advertising and sponsorship of the divvy bikeshare system is invested into cycling infrastructure projects divvy community

related to active transportation that benefit more than just divvy users52 interview with sean wiedel december 1 2017 52 87 government funding can be used to cover capital costswhich means the government owns the assetsand is sometimes used for operating costs not unlike many public transportation systems bikeshare systems often have difficulty covering operating expenses from membership and usage fees alone because of this subsidies may be necessary to cover operational expenses and can come in the form of earmarked funds for sustainable development innovative initiatives or even specifically for bikeshare earmarked funds from specific revenue sources such as parking fees or congestion charges are preferable to general operating budgets of the department managing the program parking fees and congestion charges monetize the negative impacts that cars have on the city from the road space they take up to the air and noise pollution they cause redirecting that money to support a sustainable transport option seems logical as a cross subsidy to the system barcelona is notable for being the first city to use 100 of the net revenue from onstreet parking fees to finance its public bikeshare system bicing governments can however choose to use the general budget or specific transportation budget to fund the capital investment in bikeshare this was the case in mexico city where 100 of the capital investment for ecobici came from the citys general budget given the level of political will needed to make this happen the bikeshare system gained legitimacy inside the government general tax revenues may be needed if earmarked funds are not an option most stationbased systems in china are supported completely by government funds while a private sector company serves as the operator 731 government funding while annual membership and user fees provide a stable revenue source they rarely generate enough revenue to ensure that the system is financially selfsustaining capital bikeshare comes close with an approximate 97 farebox recovery and chicagos divvy system recovers 80 of its costs from user fares smaller cities like boulder colorado and san antonio texas recover closer to 35 of their costs at the farebox the gap between system revenues and operating costs is covered in different ways and often depends on the structure of operations nonprofit systems are typically sustained through sponsorships federal and local grants and advertising private operators as part of a publicprivate partnership fill the gap with public funding sponsorships andor advertising or with investment funding from private firms a source which has been prevalent among startup dockless operators several publiclyprocured stationbased bikeshare systemsincluding new york

way to encourage short trips and thus higher bike turnover they can also be a flat rateand therefore less punitivetied to each additional increment of time often usage fees are accrued because casual members may not understand they will be charged for exceeding the ride time limit included in the base price for hybrid systems usage fees include time overages and any charges to the user for parking a bike outside of a hub or preferred station dockless systems only assess usage fees and typically do not offer a free ride period system planners must consider the servicefee structure carefully since a significant post implementation change to the price structure is likely to cause public backlash or at the very least confusion some cities and academics have conducted studies to better understand the effect of various price structures on usage and revenue generation one such study finds that unlike private cyclists who place heavy value on parking availability at their destination bikeshare riders will make decisions related to their trip based on costs thus increasing the number of stations in already wellcovered neighborhoods may be less effective in generating uptake than siting new stations outside of the service area that allow more trips to and from existing stations within the free ride period55 many cities try to keep the price of bikeshare lower than that of mass transit and personal vehicles make it competitive with those forms of transportation and accessible to lowerincome users setting user fees requires knowledge of the habits and average routes that may be used by casual users versus longterm members as well as of the citys own criteria policies and objectives for the bikeshare system for example barcelonas bicing system is available only to residents as users are required to register for an annual membership and the system offers no daily or weekly passes this decision was made in part so that the bikeshare would not compete with the

occasional users more than regular commuters however stationbased systems are also begining to offer a relatively low 3 or less per trip fare this model encourages the operator to maximize user trips each trip generates revenue and the user to minimize trips because they are paying at the time of each trip per trip pricing may serve to lower barriers to accessing bikeshare for some groups that may not be able to make a more costly investment in a monthly or annual membership however without a discounted monthly or annual membership option commuters who take dockless bikeshare to and from work

revenue general outdoor advertising advertisements can be placed in public spaces such as on bus shelters benches or billboards many systems contract all or part of the citys outdoor advertising to the company implementing the bikeshare system estimates indicate that jcdecaux in paris generated revenues of up to 60 million us80 million annually from advertising linking bikeshare operations to the general outdoor advertising revenue means that operational expenses will be subsidized by the advertising revenue without directly touching city revenue sources the problem with this arrangement can be the lack of clarity between the costs reported and the advertising revenue taken in by the firm the lesson learned from vlib in paris and other systems with outdoor advertising revenue contracts is that separate contracts should be drafted for outdoor advertising and for operating the bikeshare system even if both contracts are awarded to the same company the revenue from all sources should go into a government or escrow account and the operator should be paid based on service levels while advertising often comes under criticism many systems create very good contractual arrangements that utilize outdoor advertising advertising on bikeshare assets the bikeshare assets themselvesbikes stations kiosks etccan also serve as advertising platforms bostons hubway bikes have

briefed on permit application requirements and strategize about how best to fieldverify operator data systems should also be in place to begin monitoring approved operator compliance and staff should consider enacting a warning or probationary period that allows operators to adjust to meet requirements if necessary before being fined for noncompliance as city staff processes and approves permits staff members responsible for bikeshare outreach should simultaneously conduct educational campaigns about how bikeshare works and the new mobility options it provides to the local community as operators are awarded permits they may launch social media campaigns or testride events that the city should support and promote when appropriate to encourage bikeshare ridership following the

problems during the launch for example prior to launching in 2015 philadelphias bikeshare system laid coming soon stickers on the sidewalk where stations were going to be placed similar ly atlantas relay system set up virtual hubs where users could return bikes before all of the stations were implemented a soft launch or demonstration period of the bikeshare system can be invaluable in generating user feedback users can see firsthand how the system will work and get a feel for the process of checking a bicycle in and out soft launch users can also identify potential usability issues or common questions the city should address prior to the actual launch test run of hardware and software the operator has an opportunity to try out the hardware and software with informed personnel from each system on hand to answer questions and work out any potential issues media coverage a soft launch serves as a positive media event that could generate continued coverage leading up to the actual launch the official system launch should be a highprofile event framed to the press and the public as a victory for the city and featuring appearances by important city officials and even local

following the launch of atlantas relay bikeshare volunteer ambassadors set up tables at community events to encourage registration and help users navigate the systems mobile app from the day the bikeshare system is launched it will be evaluated on whether it is meeting exceeding or falling below the goals it promised to achieve those goals should have been articulated in servicelevels agreements between the implementing agency and the operator as described in subsection 641 the service levels need to be realistic at the outset and if the operator is not achieving them it must be determined whether the operator is failing to meet the service levels because of negligence or unrealistic expectations flexibility and communication between the operator and the city are essential while the main operational measures will be established in the tender and contract service levels may need to be readjusted or refined so the operator is continuously incentivized to innovate and excel in areas where resources can create the greatest change or benefit to the user and the system as a whole,"[101, 3471, 2076, 1996, 4888, 2005, 2742, 3188, 2000, 12106, 1999, 2325, 4407, 2015,

result of traffic congestion reduction due to mode shift away from personal vehicles and physical activity exposure to particulate matter from vehicle emissions has been linked to serious respiratory health problems and concentrations of particulate matter are higher around hightraffic roadways bikeshare offers an alternative to vehicle travelespecially for short tripsand can help reduce local traffic by taking cars off the road a study of washington dcs capital bikeshare system found that up to a 4 reduction in neighborhood traffic congestion could be attributed to the availability of bikeshare in that neighborhood59 less traffic congestion translates to reduced air pollution which benefits not only bikeshare users but all city residents the physical activity offered by biking compared to other sedentary transport modes should also be captured when valuing the health benefits of bikeshare qualityadjusted life years qaly is an index used to quantify the impact of

bikeshare trips tend to be shorter in travel time and less expensive thus surveying bikeshare users to estimate time savings and monetary savings as a percent of individual income compared to other modes can be used to estimate the economic benefit of a bikeshare system a 2017 study showed taking bikeshare in new york city to be faster than taking a taxicab on short trips up to 3 km during high congestion times such as weekday rush hours60 similarly analysis of bikeshare trips in san franciscos bayview neighborhood shows that short nonhighway trips made by pedal assist ebike are faster and less expensive than other available modes61 in addition to saving time bikeshares pertrip price is highly economical for users with annual bikeshare subscriptions in the us costing about the same as a monthly transit pass an analysis conducted by value penguin an organization focused on personal finance found that the average commuter would save us76 per month using an annual bikeshare membership instead of transit with that number soaring over us100 in cities like washington dc los angeles and new york62 studies show that bikeshare also has the potential to generate local economic activity a

total number of trips taken compared to the same ratio for vehicle trips with available data further evaluation should include the total number of cyclists killed or seriously injured ksi in years prior to the bikeshare system launch compared to cyclist ksi after the launch as well as comparing these numbers inside and outside of the bikeshare service area if the system is stationbased new york city utilized this metric to analyze the influence of bikeshare on overall cyclist ksi and found a 17 reduction within the systems original service area compared to before the system launched65 bikeshare is a relatively safe transportation option especially compared to car travel or even riding a personal bike studies show that collisions and injuries occur less often for bikeshare riders than personal bike riders perhaps due to the heavier limitedspeed design of most bikeshare bikes66 the us saw 28 million bikeshare trips taken in 2016 and only one fatality that year 000003667 access

algorithms random forest rf and leastsquares boosting lsboost were used as univariate regression algorithms and partial leastsquares regression plsr was applied as a multivariate regression algorithm the univariate models were used to model the number of available bikes at each station plsr was applied to reduce the number of required prediction models and reflect the spatial correlation between stations in the network results clearly show that univariate models have lower error predictions than the multivariate model however the multivariate models results are reasonable for networks with a relatively large number of spatially correlated stations results also show that station neighbors and the prediction horizon time are significant predictors the most effective prediction horizon time that produced the least prediction error was 15 minutes keywordsbike prediction bikesharing systems urban computing i introduction a growing population with more people living in cities has led to increased pollution noise congestion and greenhouse gas emissions one possible approach to mitigating these problems is encouraging the use of bikesharing systems bsss bsss are an important part of urban mobility in many cities and are sustainable and environmentally friendly as urban density and its related problems increase it is likely that more bsss will exist in the future due to relatively low capital and operational costs ease of installation pedal assistance for people who are physically unable to pedal for long distances or on difficult terrain and better tracking of bikes 1 one of the first bsss in the united states was established in 1964 in portland with 60 bicycles available for public use although bsss are still relatively limited at present many cities such as san francisco and new york have launched programs these programs implement different payment structures conditions and logistical strategies of primary interest to this paper are those that rely on

using a bicycle like a taxi bixi with its use of advanced technologies for implementation and management illustrates a shift into the fourth generation of bsss 2 in 2013 san francisco launched the bay area bike share bss a membershipbased system providing 24hoursperday 7daysperweek selfservice access to shortterm rental bicycles members can check out a bicycle from a network of automated stations ride to the station nearest their destination and leave the bicycle safely locked for someone else to use 3 the bay area bike share is designed for short quick trips and as a result additional fees apply for trips longer than 30 minutes in this system 70 bike stations connect users to transit businesses and other destinations in four areas downtown san francisco palo alto mountain view and downtown san jose 3 bay area bike share is available to everyone 18 years and older with a credit or debit card the system is designed to be used by commuters and tourists alike whether they are trying to get across town at rush hour traveling to and from bay area rapid transit bart and caltrain stations or pursuing daily activities 3 this paper proposes an approach to modeling the number of available bikes at a bike share station using machine learning since the number of available bikes at a station which has a finite number of docks fluctuates a repositioning or redistribution operation must be performed periodically coordinating such a large operation is complicated time consuming polluting and expensive 1 predicting the number of available bikes in each station over time is one of the key tasks to making this operation more efficient in this study random forest rf and leastsquares boosting lsboost algorithms were used to build univariate prediction models for available bikes at each bay area bike share station however to reduce the number of required prediction models for the entire bss network we also used partial leastsquares regression plsr as a multivariate regression algorithm following the introduction this paper is organized into five sections section ii briefly discusses related work from the literature focusing on the methods proposed in previous studies next a background of the regression models used is presented in section iii in section iv the different data sets used in this study are described the details of the data analysis used to construct predictive models of the number of available bikes are preprint provided in section v finally the paper concludes with a summary of new insights and recommendations for future research on modeling the number of available bikes ii related work the modeling of bike sharing data is an area of significant research interest proposed models have relied on various features including time weather the built environment and transportation infrastructure in general the main goals of these models have been to boost the redistribution operation 46 to gain new insights into and correlations between bike demand and other factors 710 and to support policy makers and managers in making optimized decisions 7 11 froehlich neumann and oliver used four predictive models to

tested the model against actual bicycle traffic counts the results demonstrated that the weather had a significant and important impact on bike usage the authors found that the weather data namely temperature rain humidity and clearness were generally significant temperature and rain specifically had an important effect a multivariate linear regression analysis was used by rixey to study stationlevel bss ridership 10 that study investigated the correlation between bss ridership and the following factors population density retail job density bike walk and transit commuters median income education presence of bikeways nonwhite population negative association days of precipitation negative association and proximity to a network of other bss stations the author found that demographics the built environment and access to a comprehensive network of stations were critical factors in supporting ridership this paper makes two major contributions to the literature first the univariate response models that have been used previously to predict the number of available bikes at each station ignore the correlation between stations and might become hard to implement when applied to relatively large networks thus this paper investigates the use of multivariate response models to predict the number of available bikes in the network second station neighbors which are determined by a trips adjacency matrix are considered as significant predictors in the regression models iii methods in this section we will briefly describe the three machine learning algorithms used in this paper rf lsboost and plsr a random forest rf breiman proposed rf as a new classification and regression technique in supervised learning 16 rf creates an ensemble of decision trees and randomly selects a subset of features to grow each tree while the tree is being grown the data are divided by employing a criterion in several steps or nodes the correlation between any two trees and the strength of each individual tree in the forest affect also known as the forest error rate in classifying each tree practically the mean squared error of the responses is used for regression rf offers several advantages 16 17 for example there are very few assumptions attached to its theory it is considered to be robust against overfitting it runs efficiently and relatively quickly with a large amount of data and many input variables without the need to create extra dummy variables it can handle highly nonlinear variables and categorical interactions and it ranks,"[101, 2193, 1997,

each variables individual contributions in the model however rf also has a few limitations for instance the observations must be independent which is assumed in our case b leastsquares boosting lsboost lsboost is a gradient boosting of regression trees that produces highly robust and interpretable procedures for regression lsboost was proposed by friedman as a gradient based boosting strategy 18 using square loss 22 where is the actual training and is the current cumulative output 0 1 1 1 the new added training is set to minimize the loss in which the training error is computed as in 19 1 where is the current residual error and the combination coefficients are determined by solving 0 in this paper rf and lsboost were used as univariate regression techniques to model the number of available bikes in each station at any time rf and lsboost are ensemble learning algorithms which integrate multiple decision trees to produce robust models however the main difference between these two algorithms is the order in which each component tree is trained using randomness rf trains each tree independently whereas lsboost trains one tree at a time and each new added tree is set to correct errors made by previously trained trees the ensemble model is produced by synthesizing results from the individual trees c partial leastsquares regression plsr plsr was recently developed as a multivariate regression algorithm 2024 plsr finds a linear regression model by projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to a new space the basic model in the plsr method consists of a regression between two blocks ie and furthermore preprint this model contains outer relations for each of the and blocks and an inner relation that links both blocks plsr has several advantages for example it is suitable when the matrix of predictors has more variables than observations and when there is multicollinearity among observable variable values moreover the plsr method outperforms multiple linear regressions because implementing plsr develops stable predictors in this paper plsr was used as multivariate regression to reduce the number of required prediction models

as shown in fig 1 25 this study used two data sets the first data set includes station id number of bikes available number of docks available and time of recording the time data include year month day of the month time of day and minutes at which a record was documented as an incident was documented every minute for 70 stations in san francisco over 2 years this data set contains a large number of recorded incidents this data set was exposed to a changedetection process to determine times when a change in bike count occurred at each station from this data set as a result of preprocessing the station id number of bikes available month day of the week and time of day were extracted for use,"[101, 2169, 10857, 3265, 5857, 1999, 1996, 2944, 2174, 21792, 2036, 2038, 1037, 2261, 12546, 2005,

other variables describing the daily weather for each zip code over the 2year period the number of available bikes at station at time the number of available bikes at its neighbors at the same time month of the year day of the week and time of day were all extracted from the two data sets as parameters that affect the model specifically the neighbors of a station were defined based on the number of trips originated from station in which and ended at station in that sense we generated the adjacency matrix of the bss network and found the highest 10 indegree stations for station which were assigned as neighbors of station in addition an unpublished work by the authors 26 investigated various weather data as predictors to determine the reasonable parameters that mainly affect the

regression to reduce the number of required prediction models for bike stations in the bss network when a bss network has a relatively large number of stations tracking all the specified models for each bike station becomes complex and timeconsuming for that reason we examined the adjacency matrix of the bay area bss network and found that the network can be divided into five regions as shown in fig 4 in fact the bike stations that resulted from the adjacency matrix in each region were found to share the same zip code this means that the majority of bike trips occurred within the same region and very few trips went from one region to another fig 4 adjacency matrix of the bay area bike share network using plsr as a regression algorithm can build prediction models for multivariate response therefore plsr was applied to reduce the number of models to five each of which is specified for one region ie one zip code to reflect the spatial correlation between stations the input predictors

mae of 058 bikesstation on the other hand the multivariate model plsr was applied to model available bikes at the spatially correlated stations of each region obtained from the trips adjacency matrix results clearly show that the univariate models produced lower error predictions compared to the multivariate model in which the mae was approximately 06 bikesstation however the multivariate models results might be acceptable and reasonable when modeling the number of available bikes in bss networks with a relatively large number of stations investigating bss networks in terms of determined regions gives new insights to policy makers the fact that stations in each region derived by the multivariate analysis share the same zip code implies that most of the trips were short distance which may be influenced by the overtime fees applied when trips are longer than 30 minutes the results also illustrate that station neighbors prediction horizon time and weather variables eg temperature and humidity were found to be significant in modeling the number of available bikes specifically when the prediction horizon time increases the prediction error increases with the most effective prediction horizon being 15 minutes determining prediction horizon is beneficial to policy makers and technicians to learn how to manage the bss more responsively and achieve better performance in prediction future work could model the number of available bikes by adding memory as a predictor to handle information related to the number of available bikes in the past acknowledgment this research

repositioning strategy employed we also show that increasing repositioning potential does not always improve service performance keywords bike sharing dockless rebalancing optimization 1 introduction in recent years bike sharing systems bss have become more prevalent in major cities in response to global climate change and inconveniences from heavy trac congestion 1 bss are bicycle programs intended to provide an alternative to private transportation and improve rst and last mile connections to other modes of transit while bss were introduced in amsterdam in the 1960s they did not become globally popular until the early 2010s after technological advances allowed for more ecient payment methods and more accurate bike tracking systems 2 today bss exist in over 1000 cities with a global eet of nearly 15 million shared bicycles 3 currently there are two main types of bss dockbased and dockless in a dockbased bss users take bikes from and return them to xed docks or stations strategically placed around a city dockbased bss and associated problems related to imbalance between supply and demand of bikes at stations have been studied in depth ghosh et al presents a thorough summary of existing literature on dockbased bss and repositioning techniques 3 in a dockless bss bikes are picked up and dropped ofrom any location within the city that allows bike parking dockless bikes are located unlocked authors contributed equally data collection and partial preprocessing 1 arxiv200411565v1 cscy 24 apr 2020 and paid for through a smart phone app the focus of the current paper is performing repositioning eciently in a dockless system using data from singapore as a test case repositioning or rebalancing is a strategy used by both dockbased and dockless system operators in an attempt to mitigate lost demand it involves moving bikes from congested locations too many bikes to starved stations too few bikes repositioning can be dynamic which involves moving bikes throughout the day to x imbalances during peak hours or static which involves resetting the system to predetermined initial conditions overnight when demand is negligible 1 even with rebalancing imbalances between supply and demand caused by limited bike capacity at each station exist in dockbased bss in addition dockbased systems are limited by the ease of access to docking stations 1 dockless systems do not face these issues as a result dockless bss have increased in popularity throughout asia particularly in china where two freeoating bikesharing companies dominate the market 4 after populating china with millions of bikes these two chinese companies launched dockless campaigns in singapore in early 2017 during the same time multiple singaporean companies also launched

bikes grew to be unmanageable and utilization rates of bikes were extremely low singapores land transit authority lta was forced to take restrictive measures on dockless bss via an operator license in 2017 this restrictive license combined with low utilization rates leading to low revenue led to the decline of dockless bss in singapore as multiple bikesharing companies exited the market the issues faced in singapores dockless bss are not unique other dockless systems around the world including shared bikes and shared electric scooters have been facing similar problems in recent years these problems such as mismanagement of dockless eets and low revenue for companies may be avoidable in the future with the benet of proper research and optimization models for dockless systems when repositioned and managed properly bss provide an environmentally friendly and congestion reducing alternative to private transportation in cities as well as promote a healthy lifestyle among citizens specically dockless sharing systems provide users with more exibility and ease of access than dockbased systems in this paper we propose a new method for modeling and optimizing repositioning tasks of dockless bss based othe work of ghosh et al 5 we propose a datadriven methodology to dene abstract stations and extract trips in dockless bss we then develop a mixedinteger program mip to generate optimal repositioning tasks for dockless bss we demonstrate the applicability of our model by studying the dockless bss in singapore during september 2017 when the aforementioned companies ooded the market since little research has been done on repositioning methods in dockless bss we use our mip to evaluate lost demand calculated via a demand model based on historical trip data in the presence of two dierent repositioning strategies a modied form of static repositioning and dynamic repositioning we focus on a subset of the data from the northern region of singapore for computational eciency since the lta operator license expected dockless bss companies to take a more conservative approach to eet size and exhibit higher bike utilization rates in the future 6 a main focus of our research is exploring the tradeos between repositioning strategies and lost demand in the presence of a diminishing eet size we believe our methodology can also be easily adapted for other shared mobility systems such as electric scooters and easily modied to study dierent objectives such as environmental impact of such systems the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the demand model developed to estimate the demand for bikes at each station in the dockless bss and the mixed integer program mip developed to optimize the dockless bss in the presence of dierent repositioning strategies section 3 proposes the denition for trips and stations which were used in this research and can be applied to the general case of a dockless bss section 4 presents our results and and section 5 discusses future research directions 2 2 models we develop two models in our research first we develop a demand model based on poisson random variables to generate demand scenarios

scenarios into our second model a mixed integer program mip that minimizes lost prot through repositioning 21 demand model the demand model works by polling a poisson process generated from historical bike trip data the data consists of an origin station destination station and timestamp for every trip however in dockless bss there is no notion of stations and the raw data consists of a collection of location pings with bike ids which must get processed and clustered into abstract stations this whole procedure is described later in section 3 once processed we combine data from certain days of the week that exhibit similar ridership timings and patterns in order to increase the amount of data at hand when generating the poisson process data from monday through thursday forms one category friday another and saturday and sunday a third these groupings are based on an analysis of variance across weekdays within our data set and ndings presented by xu et al 7 then following a similar data aggregation strategy as 8 the bike trip data is sorted into hourly bins per each category based on the start time and weekday of the trip then for each hour for every station a rate of bikes out demand on 2 minute intervals is recorded to form a poisson process to generate the demand simulation for every station the demand random variable is polled as a poisson random variable 30 times due to the 2 minute intervals and the sum of the bikes out is the demand at that station for that hour to generate complete bike trips with assigned origins and destinations a probability distribution per station is built per hour with 2minute polling intervals for the destinations of trips from historical bike data then for every station and its generated demandout the respective destination random variable is polled the demandout number of times to assign destinations and create complete trips furthermore since the trips have assigned destinations this creates an implicit model for supply when counting the number of trips that have a given station set as their destination using this technique the demand simulation can generate trips for every station at every hour of the week 22 mixed integer program in this section we describe the generic model of the dockless repositioning problem we modify the objective function inputs and a few constraints from the mixed integer linear program milp proposed by ghosh et al 5 to develop a mixed integer program mip to represent the dockless case the problem can be represented using the following tuple s v c dt ft n s denotes the set of abstracted base stations and dt s represents the number of bikes at station s s at timestep t we have a set of repositioning vehicles where c v represents the number of bike slots in the vehicle v v

that a repositioning vehicle can make only one repositioning trip per timestep by setting np and nd to 1 this includes time spent collecting bikes within the neighborhood of the abstract initial

dropped oany bikes at station s and 0 otherwise b sv is a binary decision variable it is set to 1 if vehicle v picked up any bikes from station s and 0 otherwise lk s denotes the lost demand as a

purpose for optimizing over the k demand scenarios is to come up with a single repositioning combination that works well in the general case and is not too overt the programs iterating frequency equates to rebalancing frequency and can be adjusted as well decisions are made one timestep at time and the program is iterative constraint 2 the lost demand is the decit between the net of the demand at a station and the bikes available at that station the absolute value of lk s is the number of bike trips that were lost due to improper positioning of bikes in the system this value is the sum 4 of the number of bikes present at s the net ow of bikes computed via the demand model for t timesteps into the future and the net change in bikes due to repositioning the adjustable parameter t

the y is nonzero this reason is also why the objective function looks at the y sv when counting the number of dropotrips rather than b sv directly since bss providers may develop dierent business models depending on their environment and priorities we design the mip to be as exibile as possible parameters such as cost number of repositioning vehicles rebalancing frequency etc can be easily modied to t dierent scenarios and systems this mip is not formulated as a traditional linear program however we were able to program it directly using the python extension of the ibm ilop cplex optimization studio version 129 23 mip iteration the mip described solves only for the optimal repositioning strategy at a single timestep t while considering t timesteps of demand into the future in order to optimize over a time range the mip must be iterated over increasing t timesteps and station bike amounts updated with time when iterating over the mip to extract results we choose to use a timestep t of 1 hour which aligns itself well with the demand model setup additionally since the mip considers t hours into the future as a design decision we choose to rebalance only once every t hours so to not rebalance on an articially inated demand this eectively treats the t as the rebalancing frequency as well so upon iterating on timesteps where the mip should not rebalance setting v 0 eectively turns orebalancing and then restoring the v reenables the rebalancing 5 we choose the genesis t 0 to be on a monday at midnight at t 0 for every s s its d0 s is set to a respective initial amount of bikes calculated as per section 32 the demand model is polled for all ft considering t hours into the future and then the mip is populated with all of the parameters of the respective rebalancing strategy and solved once solved the repositioning combinations y sv and y sv are recorded then a random kr is chosen from the k to be used as the guiding demand scenario at timestep t when gathering results the p s lkr s is recorded as the lost demand at timestep t and before the next iteration the station bike amounts are updated as dt1 s max n dt s f t skr f t skr p v y sv y sv 0 o in both the static and dynamic repositioning strategies the mip is for the same number of iterations to facilitate a fair comparison 3 data preprocessing for portability across datasets we dene the mip to take trip data as input however our data set for dockless bss in singapore is a collection of gps pings rather than dened trips our dataset is entries consisting of a bike id number a timestamp and

ids in order to extract trips from the gps pings in our dataset we preprocess it as discussed in section 31 section 32 expands on our approach and simplication of the dockless problem by dening abstract stations and section 33 discusses bike usage trends observed through our singaporean dataset 31 trip denition inspired from shen et al 2018 1 we lter through the data for each bike by making three basic assumptions about trips first the time between the consecutive pings should be at least 180 seconds we assume that users would not take a bike for less than 3 minutes second the gps locations between two timesteps must change by at least 200 meters for the change in location to be considered a trip this lters out inconsistencies due to instability in gps recordings finally the velocity of the trip should be lower than 25 kmhour the speed limit for bikes in singapore this check accounts for potential trips due to repositioning where the bike is in a motored vehicle in the event that all these conditions are satised a new trip is dened 32 station denition a singapore clustered b woodlands clustered figure 1 the results of kmeans clustering on singapore a and the woodlands region b 6 in order to simplify the modeling singapore was segmented into eight separate regions based on the trip data described in section 31 the origin and destination of all 939762 trips were considered as individual points the resulting 1879524 points were then clustered into eight regions using kmeans clustering we focused specically on the kmeans dened northern region of singapore labeled in figure 1 this region roughly correlates to singapores woodlands a residential town which was selected as a microcosm of singapore 9 we refer to this area as the woodlands for the remainder of the paper the selected region was then segmented again using a kmeans clustering approach with 120 clusters trips that started in the woodlands but ended in a dierent region or vice versa comprised less than 1 of the roughly 120000 trips and were ltered out for simplicity in addition of the 7821 bikes in this region 890 bikes were idle throughout the entire observation period for unknown reasons leaving 6931 active bikes the idle bikes were not considered when constructing the abstract stations as they had no associated trips the resulting 120 clusters are treated as abstract stations to understand the feasibility of and develop a physical representation for each station a radius and an area were estimated for each station the radius is determined by calculating the euclidean distance between the generated kmeans central coordinates of the station and the furthest origin or destination point within that cluster from the radius the circular area of each station was also computed each abstract station can be physically represented by the central coordinates and all of the bikes that lie within the computed radius of that coordinate of the 120 stations in the woodlands 75 of

stations have a radius less than 1 kilometer the mean radius of the 120 stations is 050 km and the mean area of the 120 stations is 101 km2 this radius and area motivated the selection of 120 as the number of stations because it simplied the dockless problem through abstraction while still producing stations that covered a small enough land area to be feasibly traversed by a dockless bss operator for repositioning the stations were granular enough such that only 13 of trips start and end at the same abstract station more stations may be added to increase accuracy given enough computational power to iterate the mip to estimate the initial number of bikes at each station we mapped the rst gps ping for each of the bikes present during the period of data collection we then assigned each bike to the closest station based on euclidean distance visual representations of the 8 regions of singapore and the 120 abstract stations in the woodlands are shown in figure 1 33 bike usage as previously mentioned unmanageable eet size was a large reason for the ltas conservative reg ulations in singapores dockless bss after being launched in 2017 dockless bikes were parked in inconvenient places clogging up sidewalks as well as mrt exits and entrances bike maintenance was dicult and faulty bikes sat on the streets for weeks or even months 1 as a result the land transport authority lta took serious restrictive measures in 2018 to regulate dockless bss two major companies had to surrender their operating licenses in singapore and many other dockless bss companies withdrew from the singaporean market in order to assure that our model and data set align with these facts we investigate trends in bike usage in our data set when considering the data for all of singapore over the month of september 2017 we notice that usage of the 47302 bikes was quite variable figure 2 breaks down the large bike eet in terms of the number of trips bikes were utilized for while the most used bike was used 123 times that month 11575 245 bikes were used 4 times and 5858 of those bikes were unused for the entire month possible explanations for the skewed distribution of figure 2 could be that bikes broke and were left on the street bikes were dropped in inaccessible locations such as hidden behind a bush there was an excess of bikes such that many of them did not need to get used to gain a better understanding of why bikes are unused in the woodlands we consider bikes idle for 7 or more consecutive days over the month of september and visualize their location alongside 7 figure 2 usage frequency of bikes over a month the abstract stations as seen in figure 3 a wide majority of the idle bikes were located at or near stations it seems bikes were left in populated areas and

on the amount of lost demand in singapores dockless bss figure 3 idle bikes black and abstract stations red 4 results for this section of the paper we demonstrate the applicability of our mip by taking the approach of a serviceoriented provider in singapore as history shows and data conrms competitive dockless bss providers overowed the city with bikes leading to harsh regulations from the

of repositioning vehicles v involved in the dynamic repositioning as displayed in figure 5 we consider eet sizes of 6931 100 4851 70 and 2772 40 and vary v from 1 to 7 for the two largest eet sizes tested the eects of changing number of vehicles are similar but with a smaller eet size of 2772 bikes the eect of adding vehicles is more considerable and surprising the red line representing 2772 bikes in the lost demand plot of figure 5 reaches a minimum when there are only 3 rebalancing vehicles in the system while the number of repositioning trips taken increases linearly r2 0985 insinuating that adding repositioning vehicles after a critical point worsens system performance we infer that this trend is due to the repositioning frequency in the dynamic scenario we study here the mip minimizes lost demand considering only the current hour increasing the repositioning potential might help minimize lost demand for some timesteps but destabilize the system and lead to unmanageable periods of lost demand at peak hours looking at the simulation data strengthens this hypothesis as peaks of large lost demand appear around peak hours for larger bike eet sizes we infer that any vehicles added after 3 are essentially idle as the lost demand approaches zero then and the number of rebalancing trips plateaus until v 6 there is a spike in the number of rebalancing 9 figure 4 dynamic and static rebalancing under varying fleet size trips taken when v 7 and we encourage further investigation in higher repositioning eet sizes to understand this spike 5 future work in this paper we presented a viable framework for solving the repositioning problem for dockless bss operators nevertheless we see several areas to extend our work the demand model used in our work assumed independence between stations meaning the demand at stations is polled independently from geographically neighboring stations this does not accurately model circumstances where there is a dependence in demand among stations for example if it is raining over a certain station and demand is low it is very likely neighboring stations demands will also suer incorporating such correlated demand scenarios into k would yield more accurate rebalancing combinations in addition our denition of static repositioning is slightly dierent from the denition other related research such as 3 related research denes static repositioning as resetting the system to predened states at night when demand is negligible optimizing bss and analyzing the lost demand under such a denition requires a completely dierent linear program we expect that the altered denition of static repositioning would perform better than our denition due to the higher granularity of where and how many bikes can get repositioned however the feasibility of such a system suers greater than ours if many lowcapacity eg moving only 1 bike repositioning trips are required to bring the system back exactly to the desired state to keep the problem simple we made a deliberate decision to scale the initial station bike amounts linearly when generating the datasets of varying eet sizes however there are,"[101, 1997,

tendencies for repo sitioning trips to pick up bikes from a general subset of stations and dropoat another subset more intelligent eet initial conditions could be generated than our linear model if these patterns are taken into consideration additionally the 100 eet is entirely based on the initial placement of bikes in our dataset it is likely suboptimal and would require the same attention optimizing these initial conditions may produce better results however we decided to accept the simple linear transformation of initial station bike amounts since over enough iterations of the mip the system will eventually converge to an optimal placement of bikes 10 figure 5 varying bike and vehicle fleet sizes in addition other clustering algorithms such as community detection could be used for dening abstract stations the number of abstract stations used could also be increased to improve accuracy of the results thinking of dockless bss an interesting research and optimization topic not discussed in this paper considers nding optimal routing strategies to pickupdropobikes either statically or dynamically the linear program was designed to be as adaptable to dierent scenarios as possible and we believe it could be a useful tool for future research on dockless bss and other dockless systems such as electric scooters 6 conclusion dockless bike sharing systems are an innovative ecofriendly solution to transportation in urban environments rebalancing strategies have shown to improve the performance of docked bss 3 and while the process may be more involved for dockless bss rebalancing can have a considerable impact in those systems as well the mixed integer program and data preprocessing techniques we propose form a exible framework to model dockless bss trends and rebalancing strategies the adjustable objective parameters allow for researchers and bss providers to optimize for their own priorities whether it be customer satisfaction prot or some mixture of both results from running the mip model over data collected in the woodlands region of singapore revealed interesting relationships which may drive crucial operations decisions of bss providers for example increasing the number of vehicles available to reposition bikes did not always improve the lost demand of the system for certain eet sizes which may be counterintuitive at rst in addition adjusting the eet size had a larger impact on the amount of rebalancing trips required to sustain the system for dynamic repositioning when compared to static repositioning overall rebalancing strategies vary based on the environment and goals of the operator and we hope our simulation framework will be a useful tool in comparing potential bss approaches or facilitate related further research the code for the data preprocessing demand model and mixed integer program used to extract the simulation results in this paper is available upon request 11 acknowledgements we thank professor patrick jaillet for

shared bikes in the dockless bikesharing system a typical example of the resourcesharing system which may lead to potential customer churn and lost prot gradually becomes a vital problem for bikesharing rms and their users to resolve the problem we rst formulate the bikesharing system as a markovian queueing network with higherdemand nodes and lowerdemand nodes which can provide steadystate probabilities of having a certain number of bikes at one node a model reduction method is then designed to reduce the complexity of the proposed model subsequently we adopt an operatorbased relocation strategy to optimize the reduced network the objective of the optimization model is to maximize the total prot and act as a decisionmaking tool for operators to determine the optimal relocation frequency the results reveal that it is possible for most of the shared bikes to gather at one lowdemand node,"[101, 2005, 2470, 1998, 2974, 6047, 2415, 2023, 2470, 2001, 4114,

eventually in the long run under the inuence of the various arrival rates at different nodes however the decrease of the number of bikes at the highdemand nodes is more sensitive to the unequal demands especially when the size of the network and the number of bikes in the system are large it may cause a signicant loss for operators to which they should pay attention meanwhile different estimated values of parameters related with revenue and cost affect the optimization results differently keywords dockless bikesharing system markovian queueing network relocation unequal demand 1 introduction the existence of idle resources and peoples willingness to well use them to promote the sharing economy has brought several lifestyle changes including various trafc modes the sharing economy means people can share resources eg services skills assets etc through a network of private individuals and businesses which may often but not al ways be at lower costs shared mobility a typical resource sharing pattern has become more popular and common such as bikesharing 1 ridesharing 2 carsharing 2 and electric vehicle sharing 3 apparently the shared transport emergence contributes to protecting the environment conserving energy reducing trafc congestion and improving transportation resource utilization and availability 4 however there remain some limitations of current shared transport systems for instance users cannot nd an available shared vehicle or bicycle nearby sometimes or they have to spend too much time seeking idle ones when they are in a hurry sometimes the idle cars or bikes are parked in low demand areas causing potential prot loss for operators 3 an essential reason is tidal commuter ows 1 more specically citizens usually travel from residential areas or home to public transit locations subway stations or popular areas eg commercial zones during peak hours thereby resulting in rare bikes in residential zones whereas the overwhelming number of shared bikes near popular zones 5 an optional solution for improving this is to rebalance or reposition shared resources eg reposition sharedbikes by trucks in bikesharing systems see 6 and reposition shared cars in vehicle sharing systems see 3 algorithms 2021 14 47 httpsdoiorg103390a14020047 httpswwwmdpicomjournalalgorithms algorithms 2021 14 47 2 of 20 this paper focuses on bikesharing and aims at solving rebalance problems existing in bikesharing systems generally there are two typical types of bikesharing systems the traditional bikesharing system with docking stations eg citi bike divvy and ford gobike in america see 1 and the dockless bikesharing system eg mobike in china see 5 the dockless bikesharing system the focus of this work and the latest type of bikesharing system also termed the freeoating bikesharing system implies users are allowed to park their bikes everywhere they want rather than xed docking stations as the dockless bikesharing system emerges the traditional bikesharing system tends to lose competitiveness and gradually vanish in some countries especially china numerous previous studies concentrate on optimizing rebalance or

many idle bikes drop off decisions to which station to drop off bikes and the routing decisions and then the rebalance strategy is executed by a eet of trucks see eg 6810 such a rebalance approach requires accurate demand prediction and cannot handle dynamic settings in realtime well the userbased approach attempts to guide customers to rebalance the sharedbikes by providing monetary incentives eg recommend pickup or dropoff areas for users see 5 design incentive programs see eg the bike angels program in 1 instead of determining the optimal practical level decisions ie pickup and delivery decisions and incentive policies for userbased rebalance this work focuses on analyzing how the key factors affect system performance based on the markovian queueing networks formulation and optimizing the rebalance frequency the rest of this paper is organized as follows the relevant literature on resource sharing system and rebalance in bikesharing system is reviewed in section 2 in section 3 we rst present a complete problem description and then introduce the markovian queue ing networks formulation in section 31 afterwards the rebalance strategy optimization model is presented in section 32 section 4 provides the analysis and discussion of the steadystate probabilities derived from the theoretical models under the inuence of un equal demands moreover we address the prot analysis based on the optimization model in this section finally some valuable conclusions and suggestions about the dockless bikesharing system especially from the operators perspective are presented in section 6 2 literature review initially few articles focus on the feasibility and impacts of bikesharing as a new public transportation mode in urban areas 1113 recently more papers begin to discuss the sustainable development of bikesharing systems especially the dockless bikesharing systems 101419 because the study of dockless bikesharing is still in progress and some mature studies on the stationbased bikesharing can guide the development of the study on dockless bikesharing we review the literature on both stationbased bikesharing and dockless bikesharing some other typical transport sharing systems are mentioned due to their contributions to resource sharing these related studies can be classied into three major categories system design system analysis and system optimization each category involves a review of some major topics and relevant progress 21 system design to build or expand a bikesharing system bikesharing rms need to select an area and investigate the potential demand for shared bikes based on the essential research these rms decide the scale of the network system select bike pickup locations and allocate shared bikes to each node in the

implies that the covid19 leads to huge uncertainty and change in travel demand for bikesharing systems which bring new challenges on travel demand prediction and operation issues 23 system

resources we mainly review rebalance related literature in this section optimizing resourcesharing systems by relocation which means relocating shared resources eg cars and bikes to solve the problem of imbalanced distribution of resources and try to make supply meet demand is mainly discussed taking shared bikes as an example a main principle is to move extra bikes from locations which have a surplus supply of bikes to locations which have a shortage of bikes relocation strategies have two primary types operatorbased relocation strategy see 68101415 and userbased relocation strategy see 1573637 some studies perform joint rebalance strategy by merging them together see eg 19 an operatorbased relocation strategy means relocation is driven by op erators behavior eg reposition by trucks and a userbased relocation strategy means relocation is directly driven by users eg design appropriate incentives in the early stage the userbased relocation strategy may be sufcient to handle imbalance for the system when userbased relocation is insufcient operatorbased relocation is applied by using a eet of trucks to relocate bikes through welldesigned routes liu et al solved a static relocation problem and minimized the weighted sum of three factors inconvenience level of nding an available bike lost demand and operational time 38 brinkmann et al proposed a stochasticdynamic lookahead policy to cope with changing demand patterns 39 legros used a markov decision process to determine the priority of stations where bikes need to be relocated and minimizes the ratio of arrival rate of unsatised users who cannot nd any bikes to determine the number of relocated bikes at appointed stations 40 brendel et al adopted a userbased relocation strategy to increase usage in an electric vehicle sharing system 41 reiss et al combined operator based relocation with userbased relocation which is called as a hybrid relocation strategy in a dockless bikesharing system 42 several factors affect the performance of relocation strategy eg region partitioning policy demand prediction faulty bikes etc many studies optimize the relocation strategy based on region partitioning but usually the region partitioning results seems to be inefcient due to no wellpredened geographical zones for example for irregular areas inefcient zone partitioning decisions may lead to very large,"[101, 2084, 10798, 2291, 1998, 18105, 18428, 3070, 2291, 11598, 2015, 1996, 15873, 2791, 1996, 10673, 2000, 9507, 23217, 3512, 2824, 1997, 3923, 3665, 3001, 4661, 2027, 2179, 1037,

errors in relocation stage jin et al 19 investigated the effects of geographical zone scale on the imbalance estimation of the dockless bikesharing system and the relocation decisions besides they developed a region decomposition approach to handle large scale instances based on appropriate scales cheng et al 17 designed a recurrent neural networksbased realtime rental and return demand prediction approach which can offer estimated demand information as input parameters for rebalance optimization model moreover sometimes faulty bikes will lead to infeasibility of relocation strategy 15 more specicity all the shared bikes in the system including faulty ones are assumed as available inventory if faulty bikes are not considered in the problem this assumption makes operators fail to estimate the actual realtime supply information and is more likely to result in impractical rebalance decisions du et al 15 formulated the bike rebalancing problem with faulty bikes and operatorbased rebalance policy for dockless bikesharing systems where a eet of heterogeneous trucks multiple depots and multiple visiting are considered usama et al 14 explicitly considered the shifting decisions of faulty bikes rather than relocating them to the nearest station ie bring broken bikes to the depot for repair most existing literature related to rebalancing optimization adopts integer program ming reinforcement learning and heuristic approaches which aim to make operational level decisions eg truck route and the number of bikes to pickupdrop off at each node a few studies use queueing theory to model bikesharing problems and provide tactical level decisions eg rebalance frequency sayarshad et al obtained the queueing delay by using the queueingbased approximation and related the delay to a cost constraint of a dynamic relocation optimization model 43 samet et al presented a closed queuing network model for a stationbased bikesharing system 44 for stationbased bikesharing

to node j n all of the nodes are fully connected because of the customers bike trips the transition probabilities can reect the information of customers destinations as well as geographical environment if the route between two nodes is long and steep there will be a low probability of riding bikes between these two nodes high demand leads to a large value of the arrival rate,"[101,

the main assumptions are made as follows 1 customers arrive at a node one by one for picking up bikes rather than arriving in groups 2 the interarrival times of customers are exponentially distributed ie the number of customer arrivals within a unit time interval is poisson distributed with an arrival rate i at node i and the arrivals at each node are completely independent 3 all of the probabilities are the same for each route from a start node to a destination node which can also be the start node itself which means pij 1 n for every pair of i and j 4 the time spent on picking up or dropping off bikes is negligible which means customers do not have to wait in lines at any node in the network and the trip time is not considered as an independent parameter in the theoretical models as our focus is the steady states in the long run but it is included in the simulation model 5 the number of bikes is evenly distributed at each node at the beginning of the operation and the total number of bikes in the system is xed 6 the capacity of each node is large enough to accommodate k bikes 7 if a node has no bike during a period of time customers will still arrive randomly and leave immediately and the service for these customers will be regarded as the lost demand the notations are summarized in table 1 table 1 overview of notations notation units denitions n nodes total

queueing network with higher demands samet et al studied the possibility of applying a model reduction method to a closed queueing network 44 the aim is to reduce the complexity of the network model when the network model is used to model a dockless bikesharing system both the excessive nodes and their intricate relationship increase the burden of calculation rapidly and make the problem more difcult to solve considering the potential barrier a model reduction method is adopted based on the basic idea proposed by samet et al 44 the main idea of this method is to aggregate multiple nodes into a virtual single node the additive property of independent poisson random variables demonstrates its reliability from a demandside perspective if taking a threenode network as an example we reduce a threenode system into a twonode system with a virtual node ie a combination of two of the nodes it is shown by the results that the aggregation of two nodes reduces the state space of the

of relocation in this paper we assume that a more effective relocation strategy is able to reduce the value of p0 more rapidly which can be described as p 0 crp0c 0 0 p 0 represents the steadystate probability of having zero bikes at node i under the inuence of relocation the formulas and descriptions are based on the markovian queueing network model with higher demands when operators implement the relocation strategy more frequently p 0 decreases from a basic value of p0 to determine the relationship between the probabilities without relocation and the probabilities with relocation we have p 0 crp0 when p 0 equals p0 cr 1 where the value of r represents no relocation is implemented in the system r c 1 means the operators start to relocate bikes considering that the sum of all the probabilities equals 1 the other probabilities are assumed to increase proportionately to satisfy the constraint which are given by p l bpl l 1 k 24 for k l0 p l 1 we have b 1 crp0 1 p0 25 p l crp0 l 0 1crp0 1p0 pl l 1 k 26 our aim is to maximize the total prot obtained by the operators of the dockless bike sharing system after implementing the relocation strategy the operating revenue comes from the customers who rent the shared bikes and return them successfully without any trouble in reality the customers often have to pay for the time they spend using the bikes we assume that the operating revenue is in proportion to the customer demand the number of available bikes at each node and the unit price charged by the operators if there is a high demand for shared bikes or there is a large number of available bikes in the area it is likely to squeeze more revenue from the customers based on the adjusted probabilities of having a number of bikes at node i the operating revenue is given by k l0 p lli k l0 p lk l cin k k l0 p lli cin 27 the operating cost can be divided into the cost of relocations which is assumed to be in proportion to the relocation frequency and the unit cost of implementing the relocation strategy and the penalty derived from the unmet demands which is assumed to be in proportion to the arrival rate the possibility of having zero bikes at each node and the unit cost of penalties due to the given constraint for r if no relocation is implemented in the system the cost of relocations will not occur according to the initial assumption that the nodes inside a virtual node are the same it is assumed that when the total number of bikes at these nodes ie the nodes which are aggregated into one virtual node is less than the number of the nodes inside the virtual node there may be no bike available at some of these nodes if the arrival rate at the node where there is no bike available for customers to algorithms 2021,"[101, 1997, 18344, 1999, 2023,

relocation strategy can reset the number of bikes at each node to an initial state which make the bikesharing system able to supply the customers with enough bikes after each relocation due to the denition of cin the high price means operators can generate more revenue by satisfying the customer demand which can be promised by frequent relocations therefore with the increase of cin both the optimal relocation frequency and the maximum prot increase according to the change of rmax and yrmax as shown in figure 7a rmax is insensitive to the increase of cin and yrmax is sensitive to the increase of cin in reality operators can make more prots by raising the unit price however they have to consider the unit price given by their competitors who have the ability to pull regular customers from them algorithms 2021 14 47 15 of 20 although acquiring a large revenue from customers can cover the expense on re locations to some extent the increase of the optimal relocation frequency is slight for operators pricing decisions have a signicant inuence on the total prot but have a slight effect on the decisionmaking about relocating bikes as shown in figure 7b with the increase of cre both rmax and yrmax decrease it is because that the high cost of relocating bikes is supposed to decrease the relocation frequency to save cost for operators with the decrease of relocation frequency the total prot decreases due to the huge expense on relocations and the decreased revenue caused by the occasional shortage of bikes at some nodes the slope of the curve in figure 7b indicates that rmax is more sensitive to the change of cre than yrmax especially when cre has a small value it is suggested that operators should consider how to reduce the expense on relocating bikes in the system which can be very benecial to solve the imbalance problem of bike distribution in figure 7c rmax increases and yrmax decreases with the increase of cp the large value of cp means a large penalty of losing customers which happens when customers arrive at the node where there is no bike available the increase of relocation frequency can minimize the losses by relocating bikes to the nodes with high demands with the increase of the penalty and the increased cost derived from frequent relocations the total prot decreases in the real world the unit cost of penalty from unmet demands is difcult to measure in the numerical experiments the value of cp is set far larger than the values of cin and cre it is because unmet demands may have a signicant impact on the loyalty of the regular customers if the customers often cannot nd any bikes to ride they are likely to feel dissatised with the dockless bikesharing system and turn to alternatives which may bring about great losses eg an obvious decrease in the potential revenue for the bikesharing company therefore setting a large value of cp in the optimization model for a relocation problem can emphasize the need for

suitable relocation frequency 423 the effect of arrival rates the arrival rate is the most important parameter which is concerned with the customer demand for bike service in the paper the inuence of the arrival rates at different nodes on the relocation problem is also investigated by a numerical experiment in figure 7d rmax increases and yrmax decreases with the decrease of i it is because that the decrease of i means the customer demand at different nodes becomes more unequal which leads to an increased possibility of the imbalanced distribution of bikes in the system frequent relocations are needed to deal with this problem due to the high cost of frequent reloca tions the total prot decreases from the results it is observed that compared with the maximum prot the optimal relocation frequency is more sensitive to the difference of the arrival rates at different nodes in the network especially when i is small when i gets close to 1 the optimal relocation frequency decreases rapidly and becomes very close to 0 therefore we suggest that the operators should pay attention to the difference of the customer demand among the nodes especially when the demand is always changing as the time goes by not only does the unequal demand have a signicant inuence on the bike distribution in the long term but also it requires multiple times of relocating bikes in the bikesharing system if the unit cost of relocations is high the operators may have to spend a huge amount of money on relocating bikes under the inuence of a small value of i algorithms 2021 14 47 16 of 20 a b c d

lowerdemand node changes at a much slower rate as a whole we guess that the number of bikes at the higherdemand node is likely to be smaller than the number of bikes at each of the middledemand nodes if there are a relatively large number of middledemand nodes and is much smaller than the number of bikes at the lowerdemand node the bike distribution at the lowerdemand node is not sensitive to the increase of the arrival rate at the higherdemand node which means bikes at the higherdemand node are likely to be scattered at both the lowerdemand node and some middledemand nodes it is suggested that the operators should pay more,"[101, 7218, 18344, 6075, 4413, 2509, 1996, 3466, 1997, 5508, 6165, 1996, 5508, 3446, 2003, 1996, 2087, 2590, 16381, 2029, 2003, 4986, 2007, 1996, 8013, 5157, 2005,

attention to the nodes with higher demands where the number of bikes decreases rapidly rather than the nodes with lower demands where the number of bikes increases relatively slowly although these all belong to two extremes of the nodes with different customer demand when the total number of bikes in the system is xed the expected number of bikes at the lowdemand node in the long run tends to decrease and its possible range becomes broader with the increase of the number of nodes and the decrease of the initial number of bikes at each node it suggests that a large number of nodes in the network can reduce the inuence of the unequal demands moderately and make the longterm bike distribution more balanced than a small number of nodes in the network meanwhile a larger initial number of bikes at each node can lead to a more imbalanced distribution of shared bikes in the system without human intervention algorithms 2021 14 47 17 of 20 the rebalance problem is solved by an operatorbased rebalance strategy based on the proper utilization of probabilistic results provided by the theoretical models the main objective is to maximize the total prot and get the optimal relocation frequency it is found that the relationship between the total prot and the relocation frequency takes the shape of a concave curve which makes it quick to nd the global optimal point by taking derivative of the expression there are various key parameters related to the optimization problem ie the indexes which can measure the effectiveness of each relocation c and the unit price cin the unit cost of relocation cre the unit cost of unmet demands cp and the different ratios of arrival rates it is common sense from a business perspective that operators prefer the solution which can bring more prots and requires a low frequency of relocating bikes the numerical experiments show that small values of c and cp and large values of can t the preference a small value of c and a large value of can reduce the probability of having zero bikes at the highdemand node which means an effective relocation strategy can result in a low frequency of relocation and increase the total prot mainly by saving the total cost when the value of c is small the maximum prot is more sensitive to the change of the optimal relocation frequency while when the value of is large the maximum prot is less sensitive to the change of the optimal relocation frequency therefore a small c and a large are complementary to each other which can provide one of the criteria for operators to select useful relocation strategies when the ratio of arrival rates is changed in the optimization model it is indicated that a large difference between the arrival rates is going to decrease the total prot and make the optimal relocation frequency increase rapidly which totally deviates from the operators purpose the unequal demands not only have an adverse effect on bike distribution but also inuence the relocation frequency and,"[101, 3086, 2000, 1996, 14164, 2007, 3020, 7670, 2073, 1996, 2193, 1997, 18105, 17913, 5901, 2738, 2084, 1996, 14164, 2007, 2896, 7670, 2073, 1996, 2193, 1997, 18105, 7457,

the prot operators can obtain what the operators can do is to balance the customer demand among the nodes as much as possible and their efforts spent on balancing can be directly reected in the benets differing from the inuence of cp a large value of cin and a small value of cre can increase both the optimal relocation frequency and the maximum total prot which means the operators can get a maximum prot and also have to carry out more frequent relocations the change of cin has a greater inuence on the total prot and the change of cre has a greater inuence on the optimal relocation frequency with the decrease of cre the maximum total prot becomes less sensitive to the change of the optimal relocation frequency which means the benet of relocating bikes gradually reduces therefore operators can consider increasing the unit price within a customers accept able range in order to make more prots if the unit cost of each relocation can be reduced signicantly a high frequency of relocation can bring more prots and satisfy more de mands the unit cost of unmet demand is the most uncertain parameter for operators so it is suggested that the operators should predict the value of cp carefully by investigation and analysis and minimize the disappointment from customers who cannot nd any available bikes to ride if possible 6 conclusions in short although our work takes a dockless bikesharing system as an example the developed methods and models can be extended to apply in some other resourcesharing systems when necessary the theoretical models are general exible and extensible in this work we rst formulate the bikesharing system as a markovian queueing network with higherdemand nodes and lowerdemand nodes thereafter we employ an operatorbased rebalance strategy and optimize the rebalance frequency at the minimum cost the results reveal that it is possible for most of the shared bikes to gather at one lowdemand node eventually in the long run under the inuence of the various arrival rates at different nodes however the decrease in the number of bikes at the highdemand nodes is more sensitive to the unequal demands especially when the size of the network and the number of bikes in the system are large it may cause a signicant loss for operators to which they should algorithms 2021 14 47 18 of 20 pay attention meanwhile different estimated values of parameters related to revenue and cost affect the optimization results differently by analysis of some factors with practical meanings this paper can bring realworld insights there are also some limitations to the study which can be regarded as directions for further research the inuence of different arrival rates on the distribution of bikes in the dockless bikesharing system is the focus of our research in the optimization model for solving the relocation problems the relocation costs can be estimated based on how many bikes are relocated but the distance of relocating bikes from one node to another is not considered which is also a limitation of our proposed methods,"[101, 1996, 4013, 2102, 9224, 2064, 6855, 2054, 1996, 9224, 2064, 2079, 2003, 2000, 5703, 1996, 8013, 5157, 2426, 1996, 14164, 2004,

the optimization models for solving relocation problems can be extended to apply to a more general markovian network model with multiple highdemand nodes and lowdemand nodes in the future study additionally the impact of covid19 can also be involved in the future research for instance highmedianlow risk areas can be regarded as various types of nodes in the markovian network these heterogeneous types of nodes are associated with various levels of demand decrease and uncertainty which brings new challenges on system optimization in bikesharing systems author contributions

different operators have different approaches to this functionality overall it requires a demandsupply analysis of the various stations while trip data can be used for this task the existing meth ods in the literature only capture the observed demand and supply rates however the excess demand rates eg how many customers attempted to rent a bike from an empty station are not recorded in these data but they are important for the indepth understanding of the systems demand patterns that ultimately can inform operations like rebalancing in this work we propose a method to estimate the excess demand and supply rates from trip and station availability data key to our approach is identifying what we term as excess demand pulse edp in availability data as a signal for the existence of excess demand we then proceed to build a skellam regression model that is able to predict the difference between the total demand and supply at a given station during a specific time period our experiments with real data further validate the accuracy of our proposed method introduction during the past few years urban and transportation planners have come to realize that if we want our cities to thrive and lead the way to a sustainable future a turn to multimodal and shared transportation is needed this has led to the fast growth of shared transportation options with shared bike systems enjoying particularly wide adoption across the world 1 the first generation of shared bike systems involves docksstations where a commuter can rent a bike from and return a bike to after a ride the second wave of shared bike systems includes dockless infrastructure that allows bikes to selflock and hence to be returned to and picked up from any place in a city however despite the seemingly convenience dockless systems offer only 4 of all the trips in 2017 were made from dockless bikes 2 while this number might have increased during the last few years cities are still reluctant for their wide adoption due to a variety of reasons eg littering of sidewalks parks and other public spaces 3 plos one plos one httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0252894 june 17 2021 1 21 a1111111111 a1111111111

is available by subscribing to history bulk in openweathermap https homeopenweathermaporgmarketplace readers can use the script from github to process this dataset for use with our models for docked shared bike systems one of the largest operational expenses is associated with rebalancing 4 rebalancing aims at redistributing bikes from stations with excess supply to sta tions with excess demand in order to assure ubiquitous availability for customers the latter is very important for customer satisfaction and retention and of course for the survival of the sys tems themselves and their associated societal and environmental benefits typically the operator utilizes one or more trucks to transfer bicycles from stations with high supply and low demand eg full stations to ones with low supply and high demand eg empty stations this happens usually in a reactive fashion ie availability levels are monitored across the stations and once it drops below a threshold rebalancing is triggered nevertheless there is a proactive element as well since operators analyze historical trip data to identify the demand and supply of each sta tion for different days and times however simply counting trips from and to a station paints only part of the demandsupply rates since zero trips from a station do not necessarily mean there is no demand for bikes if there are no bikes available any customer attempting to make a trip will not be able to rent a bike thus contributing to the excess demand of the system this information is not captured when looking purely at the number of trips 510 similarly when it comes to supply of bikes a full station will result in bikes not being able to be returned to this station 1114 however this does not mean that the supply rate is zero in this study we provide an empirical approach for estimating the excess demand and sup ply levels in a shared transportation system borrowing ideas from the parking literatureand in particular research on estimating the percentage of traffic looking for a parking spot 15 as we will elaborate in section excess demand estimation this estimation requires addi tional data from triplogs namely the number of bikes and docks available at the bike station at a highlevel for computing the excess demand similarly for the excess supply ie a station is full so a customer cannot return her currently rented bike we focus on periods with 0 avail able bikes full stations respectively then if a bike is returned at time t1 and the first rental happens at time t2 this time interval t1 t2 is very important for estimating the bike excess demand which is part of the total bike demand ie the trips observed from the data and the trips that were not possible to be completed due to lack of bikes a similar

total supply can be pre dicted at an acceptable level through a poisson regression the correlations between the supply and demand sideeach of which modeled through an independent poisson distributionare high enough that leads to biased results when using them for predicting the net total demand ie the difference between the total demand and supply the net total demand is our target of prediction since it provides direct insights for the bike operator to decide the number of bikes to be rebalanced to overcome this challenge we further develop a skellam regression model that directly models the net total demand in a station and thus accounting for this correlation in summary the contributions of our study are twofold we introduce an approach for estimating the excess demand of bike sharing systems using highlevel ideas from queuing theory key to our approach is identifying temporal segmentswhich we term excess demand pulse edpin the bike availability data that include changes in the availability from zero ie no bikes at the dock to nonzero ie someone returned a bike after introducing the theoretical underpinnings of our method we verify through simulations its

empty docks to reiterate we refer to this part of the total demand as excess demand failing to involve the excess demand will essentially provide a model that only captures the observed demand of the system essentially treating any period with zero observed rentals or returns respectively as periods of zero demand which is not true in general in a slightly different but relevant problem

demand is so high while others 8 identify over demand stations as those that are full or empty for more than 10 minutes then they propose algorithms to classify a station as an overdemand one however none of these studies attempts to estimate the volume of excess demand however there are studies that attempt to estimate the volume of excess demand using a simple method based on the duration for a station being empty 2123 these methods assume that excess demand exists every time there are zero bikes available for rental they fur ther consider this excess demand to be equal to the observed demand in adjacent time periods it should be evident that neither of these assumptions are very realistic a station can be empty and no user is interested in renting a bike from that station while the

tm 1 ts 0 1 evaluation on synthetic data since we do not have the ground truth for the excess demand in real data ie people that attempted to rent a bike but the station was empty we rely on simulations to evaluate whether eq 1 is able to accurately estimate e our simulator begins with 0 available bikes at time t 0 and ends at tend the simulator operates as follows time to next event we sample an exponential distribution with average 1 lm to generate a random interval r that represents the time duration until the next event either an arrival or a departure event type we next have to decide the type of event happening for this we sample a num ber re from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 if re l lm we label the next event as an arrival otherwise it is a departure we also update the count of available bikes a excess demand if a 0 ie there are no available bikes the next event cannot be a depar ture every time when a 0 the next event is simulated as a departure we mark it as a failed bike departure this will allow us to simulate the ground truth for the excess demand we simulate 1000 time points ie tend 1000 hours while we use 3 bikeshour 1 bikeshour by setting we can create several situations where the bike rental demand cannot be fulfilled hence generating excess demand finally we repeat the simulation 400 times in each simulation we collect the following information the average s of all the interarrival intervals the average m of all edp lengths ie t2 t1 in fig 4 we estimate the excess demand rate me using eq 1 in our setting since we assume that the

can calculate the excess demand observed on the system while the bike availability curves are just like the ones we simulated there is one important difference the excess demand rate in the real environment is not constant over time but it rather changes for example we expect the excess demand rate in the morning rush hour is higher than that in the late night there are several factors that can lead to this temporal variation ranging from peoples schedule eg during rush hours the excess demand is expected to be higher to weather conditions that change during the day this temporal dependency does not allow us to use all f intervals in the data to estimate a single constant excess demand we will need to only use limited information localized in time to estimate the excess demand rate during a specific time interval in particular we adjust the aforementioned approach in this section as follows here we still use fig 4 to describe the adjusted approach the edp in the interval t1 t2 is able to inform us about the excess demand occurring in the immediately preceding interval td t1 we can use eq 1 to calculate excess demand rate in this interval however f t2 t1 is the only edp length that we can use to calculate m given the timevarying nature furthermore we need to calculate the average intersupply interval s which again needs to be temporally localized due to its time varying nature for the setting in fig 4 we have arrival events at ta tb and t1 thus we use interarrival intervals ie ta tb and tb t1 to obtain ts tbtat1tb 2 finally we calculate me of interval td t1 using eq 1 the single edp length aforementioned may cause the calculated excess demand rate to be extreme for instance if the bike was rented almost immediately after it was returned then the excess demand rate would be calculated practically as infinite while we could eliminate such observationssince most probably correspond to users that return the bike and rerent it fig 6 average pvalues from

can also be calculated by data in our case we can focus on a period of time around the time interval of interest and estimate the excess demand for the same periods over a week if our measurement of the interval of interest was an extreme outlier then the prior will shrink the final estimate for example let us assume that we want to calculate the excess demand rate at 9301000am on a given day which is referred to as 930 first using eq 1 we calculate the excess demand rates of 9301000am interval of interest and 900 930am 10001030am periods near interval of interest of the given day this will give us 3 observations and an observed average obs then using eq 1 we calculate the excess demand rates of 900930am 9301000am and 10001030am every day since 6 days before the given day this will essentially give us 18 observations and an estimated prior average prior combining these with the bayesian average we will get our final estimate for 930 as m930 3 mobs 18 mprior 21 2 of course the choice of prior can be different but the idea is that using this approach we can smooth extreme cases in a principled way in the s1 text we further discuss how we pro cessed instances that do not follow exactly the shape of edp discussed here but appear infre quently in the data eg when multiple bikes simultaneously arrive at a station as a result of rebalancing from the operator estimating excess demand of docks in divvy chicago bike sharing system does not allow for selfdocking 11 12 thus if a bike is returned and the dock is full there is no way to return it leading to excess demand for the dock to calculate the excess demand of docks we can still use the method used to estimate the excess demand for bikes but we need to make the following adjustments the availability curve now represents dock availability ie how many racks at the station are free rather than bike availability ie how many bikes are available at the station for renting 0 dock availability means that each rack at the station is occupied by a bike the edp starts with a bike departure from a full station and quickly ends with a bike arrival this allows us to capture how quickly the rack is being utilized again thus capturing the excess demand for docks which again is timevarying f still denotes edp length based on the definitions above while m still denotes average value of f s still denotes the average value of intersupply intervals but to reiterate based on the defi nitions above in this case a supply is a bike departure so specifically s means the average value of interdeparture intervals

different stations as one might expect the excess demand rates differ among different stations the maps in figs 7 and 8 illustrate the sum of the excess demand for each station for bikes and docks respectively as we can see stations closer to the downtown area have higher excess demand rate we further illustrate in the inset figures the weekly pat terns of the excess demand in 30minute periods for two representative stations as we can see these stations exhibit very different patterns in terms of levels of excess demands both for bikes and docks however the relative spikes in each station appear to be similar to an extent furthermore when focusing on a specific station there seems to be a temporal shift between the excess demand for bikes and docks excess demand and sporting events in order to provide some context for the excess demand observed at the system we examined the estimated excess demand near the wrigley field during game days for example at 120pm on july 8 2018 there was a baseball game in wrigley field between the cubs and the reds 41 there is a divvy station only 130 meters away from wrigley field which we have also marked in fig 7 based on our calculations this station exhibited excess demand during particular time periods on that day in particular between 1230pm and 2pm there was an average excess dock demand of more than 3 docks30 minutes this is possibly due to fans riding bikes to wrigley field leading to nonempty docks furthermore between 4pm and 5pm there was an average bike excess demand of 236 fig 7 cumulative bike excess demand rate for

httpsgithubcomxinliupittskellamregression results in this section we will present our evaluation results for predicting the net total demand we will evaluate the predictive performance across two dimensions peakvsnonpeak hour predictions training based on observedvstotal demand specifically for the latter we are interested in quantifying the predictive gains achieved by considering the excess bike and dock demand and not only using recorded bike rentals and returns peak and nonpeak hours typically peakhours for a transportation system include weekdays morning 7am930am and evening commute 4pm630pm however for a bike sharing system there is also season ality especially during the summer months 45 our data also support this seasonality in par ticular the net total demand during peak hours in the summer months is approximately 6 times higher as compared to that during nonpeak hours of the year for this reason our results for peak hours below will be focused on the summer months different peak hours also have different patterns across seasons given the imbalance between the records for the peak hours per season and nonpeak hours peak hours per season cover a little less than 15 of the observations a single model would be overwhelmed by the latter and will not able to identify the peak hour patterns in different seasons hence we build separate models for different time periods in particular we learn a single model for nonpeak hours while we build two separate peak hour models one for the morning and one for the evening peak hours predicting the net total demand for particularly the peakhour periods is very important for the bike share system operator for various management operations such as conduct an effective rebalancing for learning each model we split the data from all 300 stations and use 80 of the them to train the model 10 as the validation set to optimize the regularization shrinking parameter and the remaining 10 for outofsample evaluation all

parameter in particular the twopoisson model follows the regression train ing setup in s2 text for the neural network we use 5 hidden layers 32 units per layer and a batch size of 32 for training for xgboost we set the number of estimators to 10000 for the constant prediction we use the average net total demand existing in the training set as our pre diction for each outofsample record table 3 presents the mse on the test set for two peak hours periods in the columns marked with 7930 161830 as well as the nonpeak hours in the columns marked with non peak for each period we present the mse over all the records in the test set in table 3 col umns marked with all records in the test set there are some records with nonzero excess demand that is when calculating the ground truth z of those records either nme or nle is nonzero to understand better any gains existing in predictions we also specifically present the mse of those records in table 3 this corresponds to the columns marked with excess as aforementioned these instances are very important for the bike sharing system operator since these are the situations where operations such as rebalancing are crucial note that the records with nonzero excess demand occupies 10 of the dataset for peak hours and 2 for nonpeak hours for two peakhour periods as we can observe the skellam regression exhibits the lowest error among all the models examined the benefits are even larger in situations where the excess demand is nonzero for nonpeak hours as we can see skellam exhibits only slight benefits over the twopoisson model and the neural network this could be attrib uted to the fact that during nonpeak hours there is an overall low demand for the bike sharing system and hence the twopoisson and neural network models can capture this signal finally xgboost seems to perform slightly better than skellam regression for records with nonzero excess demand however these records only occupy 2 of the dataset for nonpeak hours these could represent situations where there are special eventseg summer street fairs that boost demand during nonpeak hours apart from its performance in terms of mse skellam regression has two additional advan tages over the alternative models considered first the skellam regression as a generalized lin ear model is interpretable this is particularly important from an operators perspective since it can lead to actionable insights for example in a model built for a station during nonpeak hours for the independent variable temperature we obtain two coefficients b1temp 657 for bike demand and b2temp 690 for dock demand eq 9 these coefficients indicate that higher temperature is correlated with more people renting bikes for biking ie higher bike demand since these riders need to return the bikes the dock demand is also positively corre lated with the temperature secondly and most importantly the skellam regression model allows us to get a better estimation of the uncertainty of our prediction in particular we do not only get,"[101, 16381, 1999, 3327, 1996, 2048, 6873, 24077, 2944, 4076, 1996, 26237, 3345, 13749, 16437, 1999, 1055, 2475, 3793, 2005, 1996, 15756, 2897, 2057, 2224,

a single point estimate for the expected value of the net total demand but rather its whole probability distribution for example let us assume that our predictions are n m 1267 and n l 1029 this means that the net total demand is z 238 recall that n m and n l are the two parameters of the skellam distribution and hence we can plot the probability mass function for z as presented in fig 9 this distribution allows us to answer questions such as what is the probability that there will be excess demand during a specific time period ques tions are important for the system operators providing them with a more holistic view of the system total and observed demand in training for the results we presented above we use the total demand n and n to calculate the depen dent variable z n n one of the motivations for our study is the fact that excess demand plos one excess demand prediction for bike sharing systems plos one httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0252894 june 17 2021 16 21 is not directly available in the tripdock availability logs obtained from the bike system opera tor therefore a lot of existing literature simply uses the observed demand for building predic tive models for these models 0 trips from a station during a period is an indicator of 0 demand even though as we have seen this may very well be an instance of actually high excess demand however what if even by simply using the observed demand to train our models we can still get a good prediction for the net total demand to examine this we build our model using only the observed demand when we train the model we then evaluate the predictions on the test set and the results are presented in table 4 as we can see when training our models using the total demand observedexcess in table 4 the predictions have

our approach on data obtained from chicagos divvy bike sharing system to estimate the excess demand present in divvy sys tem to predict the net total demand which includes the observed and excess demand we learn a skellam regression model through maximum likelihood estimation which shows advantages over other alternative models both in terms of predictive performance and interpretability moreover our skellam regression model as a generalized linear model allows us to get a better estimation of the uncertainty of our prediction since we essentially obtain the whole probability distribution of our dependent variable although we mainly use bike availability records to estimate the excess demand additional data sources can potentially improve the excess demand estimation for example a customer of the bike sharing system may use the corresponding mobile application to explore the bike availability of stations near her location this search itself is a signal of bike demand and in the case where there are no available bikes nearby we can consider this to be part of the excess demand of course a good understanding of the way the corresponding app operates is required since for example if a local search is performed every time the app is turned on this is not necessarily an indicator of demand in the area however similar data are hard to be obtained as they are only available to the bike sharing operator furthermore as implied from the results in our analysis of a specific baseball game at wigley field excess demand on one sta tion might lead to spillover demand on nearby stations when focusing on the whole bike sharing system this might lead to double countingonce as the excess demand of a station and once as the observed demand of another station our framework can be further improved by extending it so one can avoid this potential double counting of total demand finally while in this paper we focus on excess demand in docked bike sharing systems excess demand also exists in dockless systems in this setting we only need to consider the excess demand of renting bikes since bikes can be returned anywhere however this also means that there are no predefined stations the lack of welldefined locations of bike demand provides additional challenges in analyzing these situations the analysis should most probably focus on predefined areas within the city however identifying the spatial granularity needed is not a trivial task supporting information s1 text special cases of excess demand pdf s2 text regression training setup pdf author
